"""Iteratively build Agent-Drafter apps by driving GPT-5.5 through the drafter tools.

Each app is built inside ONE named session ("ad-<id>") so follow-up fixes land in
the SAME conversation — build -> review -> report problems -> it fixes -> repeat,
exactly like a human iterating with the model.

  build_batch.py build <prompts.json> <start> <count>   # round 1 + auto-fix build failures
  build_batch.py fix   <id> <issue-text-or-@file>        # resume the session, feed problems back
  build_batch.py rounds <id>                             # how many refine rounds an app has had

Sandboxed so the 100 apps live in a dedicated store. Per-app transcripts + a
rounds ledger under docs/agent-drafter-stress/build-logs/.

WRAPPER = """Build ONE Biorouter app with the agent_drafter tools. Use this EXACT app id: "{id}".

REQUIREMENT:
{requirement}

HOW TO BUILD IT (do all of this, in order, then stop — do NOT launch):
1. create_app with id="{id}", a clear title and description, kind="agentic".
2. Write a self-contained, on-theme index.html (via `html` or update_app) that:
   - uses the injected Biorouter design system (br-* classes + CSS variables) — NO external CSS/JS/CDN;
   - colors ALL text with theme tokens (color: var(--br-text) / var(--br-text-muted)), NEVER hardcoded hex/rgb,
     so nothing goes invisible when themed; the app renders light by default;
   - lays out the regions the requirement needs as <section data-br-region="NAME">…</section>, each with a
     short placeholder line saying what will appear there;
   - exposes the concrete controls the requirement calls for (inputs, sliders <input type="range" class="br-slider">,
     selects, chips, buttons, drop zones, a map grid, etc.) with real ids;
   - has a visible progress surface (data-br-chat OR a br-run-status area).
3. Write src/main.ts that wires those controls to the agent: build the prompt from the control state and call
   br.run(prompt, target) / br.prompt(...) on change/click/submit, keeping the loop going across turns. Import ONLY
   from "./sdk". Show progress. GUARD every run: do NOT call br.run on page boot with an empty form, and skip the
   run when the user hasn't supplied the minimum input (e.g. `if (selected.length < 2) return;`) — handle the
   empty/partial state locally with a placeholder. Always pass the user's current selection/state INSIDE the prompt;
   never make the agent call ui_describe to discover what the user chose. If the app works through a list one item
   at a time (triage/quiz/resolve loops), the system_prompt MUST track resolved item-ids in ui_state, always pick the
   next UNRESOLVED item (never re-ask a finished one), append a numbered step to the log each turn, and define a clear
   stop condition — otherwise the loop re-asks the same top item forever.
4. configure_app (or in create_app) with a strong system_prompt telling the APP AGENT to DRIVE the interface every
   turn with the ui_* tools instead of answering in prose: which tool for which output (ui_panel/ui_render INTO the
   declared @region: regions — you can pass place="@region:NAME" to ui_panel; ui_chart/ui_graph for figures;
   ui_highlight to direct attention; ui_state to track the user's accumulated behavior; ui_ask for a structured
   choice mid-turn). Explicit and step-by-step. Set max_turns 12-20.
5. build_app. If the harness reports lint ERRORs, fix them and build_app again. Do NOT launch_app.

Aim for genuine visual craft and an interaction that actually loops. Finish by reporting the app id."""

FIX = """Keep iterating on the app "{id}" in this same session. A reviewer drove the built app in a browser
and found these problems. FIX them, then build_app again (do not launch):

Make the smallest changes that fully resolve each point; preserve what already works. Update index.html /
src/main.ts / the system_prompt as needed via update_app / configure_app, then build_app. Report what you changed."""
