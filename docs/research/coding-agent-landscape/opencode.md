# OpenCode (sst) — Agentic Feedback Loop Review

*Comparative review for BioRouter. Primary sources: opencode.ai docs, the `sst/opencode` repo, and DeepWiki's source-derived architecture pages. Every claim is cited. Where docs were thin I fetched source-file references (via DeepWiki / community source deep-dives) and flagged them. Research date: 2026-07-12. Note: the canonical repo has been mirrored/renamed across `sst/opencode` and `anomalyco/opencode` during OpenCode's history; issue/PR citations use whichever org the tracker returned.*

OpenCode is "the open source AI coding agent," built by SST as a TypeScript/Bun monorepo with a **client/server split**: the core agent logic runs as a local **Hono-based HTTP server** that owns sessions, tool execution, provider calls and state; multiple clients (Go TUI, desktop app, VS Code extension, web) connect over HTTP + **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** ([DeepWiki: Core Architecture](https://deepwiki.com/sst/opencode/2-architecture)). State persists in **SQLite via Drizzle ORM**; the OpenAPI 3.1 spec in `packages/sdk/openapi.json` generates typed SDKs with `@hey-api/openapi-ts` ([DeepWiki search](https://deepwiki.com/sst/opencode)). This decoupling — server as the single source of truth, thin clients subscribing to an event bus — is the architectural spine that all the loop mechanics below hang off.

## System prompt & context injection

OpenCode assembles the system prompt in a fixed stack, orchestrated by `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts` ([prompt-construction deep-dive](https://gist.github.com/rmk40/cde7a98c1c90614a27478216cc01551f)):

1. **Provider-specific base prompt** — a static `.txt` chosen by model id: Claude gets `anthropic.txt`, GPT/o-series get `beast.txt`, Gemini gets `gemini.txt`, etc. An agent's own prompt, if defined, *replaces* the provider file entirely.
2. **Environment block** (generated per call by `system.ts`): working directory, "Is directory a git repo," platform, model name, and today's date — plus a project file-structure listing ([open-docs system-prompts](https://github.com/bgauryy/open-docs/blob/main/docs/opencode/05-system-prompts.md)).
3. **Instruction files** (`instruction.ts`): OpenCode's context-file convention is **`AGENTS.md`**, with **`CLAUDE.md`/`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` as a migration fallback**, plus `CONTEXT.md`. It walks from the working dir up to the worktree root, then checks the global `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, first match wins per tier ([Rules docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/)). Extra files come from the `instructions` config key, which also supports **remote URLs fetched with a 5-second timeout**. Each file is prefixed `Instructions from: <path>`.

Tool descriptions are mostly static `.txt` too, but four use runtime substitution: `bash` (interpolates dir/maxLines/maxBytes), `task` (`{agents}` → available subagents), `skill` (an XML block listing each discovered skill's name/description/file), and `websearch` (`{{year}}`).

The most interesting mechanism is **mid-conversation injection**: when the `read` tool opens a file in a subdirectory, OpenCode walks *up from that file's directory* looking for instruction files not already loaded and injects them into the tool output as `<system-reminder>` blocks ([prompt gist](https://gist.github.com/rmk40/cde7a98c1c90614a27478216cc01551f)). Project rules thus arrive lazily, scoped to where the agent is actually working, rather than all up-front.

## Tool loop mechanics

The server's `SessionProcessor`/`LLM.stream` runs the reasoning loop: it calls the provider via `streamText()`, streams assistant output as **typed "parts"** (text, reasoning, tool-call, file) that decompose each message, and re-enters the loop after tool results ([DeepWiki: Architecture](https://deepwiki.com/sst/opencode/2-architecture)). Everything streams to clients over SSE, so the TUI/desktop render tokens and tool output live. Built-in tools: `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `read`, `grep`, `glob`, `list`, `apply_patch`, `lsp` (experimental), `skill`, `todowrite`, `webfetch`, `websearch` (Exa, gated by `OPENCODE_ENABLE_EXA`), `question`, and `task` ([Tools docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/tools/)). `ProviderTransform` normalizes messages across Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini so tools work vendor-agnostically.

**Parallelism is limited.** Multiple `task` (subagent) calls in one assistant turn execute *sequentially* — the session loop does `tasks.pop()`, awaits it, then continues — a known limitation ([issue #14195](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/14195)). Error handling includes `repairToolCall` for malformed/truncated calls (a `finishReason: length` truncation is a documented failure mode, [issue #18108](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/18108)).

## Compaction & memory

Compaction lives in `packages/opencode/src/session/compaction.ts` with overflow detection in `processor.ts`/`overflow.ts` ([DeepWiki: Context Management & Compaction](https://deepwiki.com/sst/opencode/2.4-context-management-and-compaction)). Rather than one blunt threshold, OpenCode layers three strategies:

- **Overflow trigger:** `isOverflow` fires when tokens exceed *usable* context = total window − reserved output (default 32,000) − a `COMPACTION_BUFFER` safety margin of 20,000. Auto-compaction is on by default; `OPENCODE_DISABLE_AUTOCOMPACT` turns it off ([badlogic compaction research](https://gist.github.com/badlogic/cd2ef65b0697c4dbe2d13fbecb0a0a5f)).
- **Tool-output pruning first** (`SessionCompaction.prune`): scans newest→oldest, **protects the last 2 turns** (`DEFAULT_TAIL_TURNS`), only prunes when total tool output exceeds 40k tokens (`PRUNE_PROTECT`) and at least 20k (`PRUNE_MINIMUM`) can be reclaimed, and **never prunes `skill` outputs**. This reclaims space by dropping verbose tool bodies while keeping the execution record (names/params).
- **Structured summarization** as a fallback: a `SUMMARY_TEMPLATE` drives a summary agent to produce a *continuation-oriented* markdown summary with sections Goal / Constraints / Progress / Key Decisions / Next Steps / Critical Context. Notably, a **"Session Memory Compact"** path reuses structured info already in session memory to *avoid an LLM call* for most auto-compactions.

Media (images/PDFs) is stripped to text placeholders (`[Attached image/jpeg: filename.jpg]`) under context pressure. After compaction the last user message is replayed (hard overflow) or a synthetic "Continue if you have next steps" prompt is appended (proactive). Cross-session memory is via **AGENTS.md** (persistent project/global rules) rather than an evolving memory store.

## Hooks & extensibility

**Plugins** are JS/TS modules — `export const MyPlugin = async ({ project, client, $, directory, worktree }) => ({ ...hooks })` — loaded from `.opencode/plugins/`, `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`, or npm packages in `opencode.json` (Bun auto-installs deps into `~/.cache/opencode/node_modules/`) ([Plugins docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/)). The hook/event surface is broad: `tool.execute.before`/`tool.execute.after`; session lifecycle (`session.created/updated/compacted/deleted/error`); `file.edited`, `file.watcher.updated`; `message.updated/removed`, `message.part.updated`; `permission.asked`/`permission.replied`; `lsp.client.diagnostics`, `shell.env`; and TUI hooks (`tui.prompt.append`, `tui.command.execute`, `tui.toast.show`). Plugins can **block** (throw to reject an operation — e.g. deny `.env` reads), **inject/mutate** tool args, env vars, or session context, and **register custom tools** with schema + execute. OpenCode also supports **MCP servers** and **ACP** (Agent Communication Protocol) for external tool/agent integration.

## Guardrails & permissions

Permissions are the central guardrail, keyed by tool class: `read`, `edit`, `bash`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `external_directory`, `task`, `skill`, `lsp`, `question`, `glob`, `grep`, and `doom_loop`, each resolving to **`allow` / `ask` / `deny`** ([Permissions docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/)). Bash (and other keys) support **wildcard pattern rules** where the **last matching rule wins**:

```json
{ "permission": { "bash": { "*": "ask", "git *": "allow", "rm *": "deny" } } }
```

Defaults are mostly `allow`, but **`doom_loop` and `external_directory` default to `ask`, and `.env` files default to `deny`.** Approval prompts offer `once` / `always` (session-scoped for matching pattern) / `reject`. **Per-agent overrides** narrow the global policy — e.g. the built-in **Plan agent** sets all edits and all bash to `ask`, giving a read-only-by-default posture ([Agents docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/)). Permission keys are matched as wildcard patterns against the underlying tool name, so the same syntax covers built-ins, custom tools, and MCP tools. Sandboxing is coarse (the `external_directory` gate scopes access to the workspace); OpenCode leans on the permission prompts + Plan mode rather than OS sandboxing.

## Loop & stuck detection

OpenCode ships **explicit doom-loop detection** — a first-class mechanism BioRouter lacks. Implemented in `session/prompt.ts`, it keeps a Map of `tool + JSON.stringify(input)` counts and escalates in stages ([PR #3445](https://github.com/sst/opencode/pull/3445), [issue #25254](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/25254)):

- **Stage 1 (3 identical calls):** inject a **non-blocking warning** nudging the model to try a different approach.
- **Stage 2 (5 identical calls):** escalate to the **`doom_loop` permission** (defaults to `ask`), pausing for user approval or failing.

It is deliberately **model-agnostic** (re-worked from a model-specific version because aliases like GLM-4.6/Grok slipped through). Scenarios it targets: repeated identical searches, re-reading the same file expecting different content, retrying the same failing patch, or re-running a command hoping for different output. There are ongoing refinements for catching repetition during reasoning/output blocks ([issue #12716](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/12716)) and for cross-message repetitions. Beyond doom-loop, the overflow/compaction machinery caps runaway context growth, and subagents carry TTLs (below).

## Long-running tasks & background processes

Delegation is via the **`task` tool**, which spins up a **subagent in a child session** ([Agents docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/)). Built-in subagents: **General** (full-access, multi-step), **Explore** (read-only fast codebase search), **Scout** (read-only external docs/deps). Which subagents a primary agent may spawn is gated by `permission.task` glob patterns. **Background subagents** are experimental — behind `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true`, `task(background=true, ...)` runs an independent session with a **30-minute TTL**; the parent can only `task_status(task_id)` for running/completed/cancelled state, with **no streaming of intermediate output** (an open gap, [issue #27828](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/27828)). As noted, multiple task calls in one turn still run one-at-a-time. Bash commands run through the server with configurable output caps (maxLines/maxBytes); scheduling/cron is not a core feature.

## State tracking & checkpoints

Two complementary systems. **Todo lists**: the `todowrite` tool manages a task list to track progress on complex operations, surfaced in the UI. **Snapshots / undo** is the standout ([Undo docs](https://v2.opencode.ai/snapshots)): OpenCode captures the worktree **before and after each model step**, recording changed paths on the assistant message, using **a separate internal Git object database in OpenCode's data dir — it does *not* create commits, move branches, or touch your repo's Git index**. Tracked + non-ignored untracked files are captured (untracked files >2 MiB excluded). `/undo` hides the selected user message and all later ones (not deleted), drops the message text back into the composer for revision, and **restores changed files to their earlier contents (deleting files that didn't previously exist)**; repeated `/undo` walks the boundary earlier while keeping a redo baseline. `/redo` un-hides messages and restores files to their pre-undo state. Exposed programmatically as `client.session.revert()` / `unrevert()`. Caveat: undo can't reverse external side effects (DB writes, shell effects), and there are known edge-case bugs in file-vs-message restoration ([issue #27664](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/27664)). **Plan mode** (the Plan agent) is the read-only "analyze first, don't edit" state.

## Self-verification

OpenCode's primary verification loop is **LSP-diagnostics-as-feedback**: 25+ built-in LSP servers auto-detect by file extension and start on demand (given deps like a Go compiler or .NET SDK); after edits the agent receives **language-server diagnostics** (type errors, lint issues) as structured feedback it can act on ([LSP docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/lsp/)). The experimental `lsp` tool also exposes definitions/references/hover/call-hierarchy for "surroundings awareness." Complementing this, **formatters run automatically after every write/edit** — checking file extension against enabled formatters (Prettier, gofmt, rustfmt/cargofmt, etc.) and applying changes in the background ([Formatters docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/formatters/)); they're opt-in (`"formatter": true`). "Done-ness" is mostly model-judged against AGENTS.md conventions rather than an enforced test gate — there's no built-in mandatory test-after-edit loop, though the `session.error` hook and diagnostics give plugins/agents the signals to build one.

## Ideas worth stealing

1. **Doom-loop detection with staged escalation.** A Map of `(tool + JSON.stringify(args))` counts, warning-inject at 3 repeats and permission-gate at 5, is cheap (O(1)) and model-agnostic. BioRouter's agent loop should add exactly this — it directly attacks the "agent re-runs the same failing edit/search" failure that wastes tokens and frustrates users ([PR #3445](https://github.com/sst/opencode/pull/3445)).

2. **Git-object-DB snapshots decoupled from the user's repo.** Capturing worktree state per model step into a *private* Git object database — no commits, no branch moves, no index changes — gives reliable `/undo`/`/redo` of agent edits without polluting the user's history. This is a much safer checkpoint model than committing to the real repo ([Undo docs](https://v2.opencode.ai/snapshots)).

3. **Layered compaction: prune tool outputs before summarizing, and skip the LLM when possible.** Protecting the last N turns, only pruning verbose tool bodies above token thresholds, exempting critical (skill) outputs, and a "Session Memory Compact" path that reuses structured state to avoid an LLM summary call — this is far more surgical (and cheaper) than one summarize-everything pass ([DeepWiki compaction](https://deepwiki.com/sst/opencode/2.4-context-management-and-compaction)).

4. **Lazy, directory-scoped context injection via `<system-reminder>`.** Instead of front-loading every rule file, inject the nearest unseen AGENTS.md when the agent reads a file in that subtree. This keeps the base prompt lean and delivers project rules exactly when relevant ([prompt gist](https://gist.github.com/rmk40/cde7a98c1c90614a27478216cc01551f)).

5. **Wildcard permission rules with last-match-wins + per-agent overrides.** A single pattern grammar (`"git *": "allow"`, `"rm *": "deny"`) spanning built-ins, custom, and MCP tools, layered global→agent, is expressive yet simple, and secure-by-default for `.env`/external dirs. It's a clean model for BioRouter's permission modes ([Permissions docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/)).

6. **LSP diagnostics + auto-formatters as a passive verification loop.** Feeding language-server diagnostics back into the agent after edits (and auto-formatting writes) gives cheap correctness signals without a bespoke test harness — a natural fit for BioRouter's multi-language research code ([LSP docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/lsp/), [Formatters docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/formatters/)).

7. **Client/server split with an SSE event bus + typed message "parts."** Making the agent a headless server that many thin clients subscribe to (and generating typed SDKs from an OpenAPI spec) is exactly BioRouter's `biorouterd` direction; OpenCode's part-based message model and SyncEvent replay are a proven reference for streaming and multi-client session sharing ([DeepWiki architecture](https://deepwiki.com/sst/opencode/2-architecture)).
