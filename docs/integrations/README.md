# Integrations with other tools

This folder documents the packages that let **another application host a Biorouter agent** — the
opposite direction from everything in [`extensions/`](../extensions/README.md), which is about
adding capabilities *into* Biorouter. An integration here is a small adapter that lives outside the
Rust workspace, speaks a host's plugin contract, and delegates the whole turn to `biorouter` so the
user gets their configured model, extensions, skills, workflows, knowledge bases, and permissions
inside the host's own chat surface.

Come here when you want to use Biorouter from a tool you already work in, or when you are writing or
maintaining one of those adapters. The adapters themselves live in the repository's top-level
[`integrations/`](../../integrations/) folder, next to the manifests that install them; the pages
here carry the architecture, the version pins and the verification record, and link out to each
package's own install instructions.
