Chat groups need each chat pane to carry its own knowledge-base selection, which means
mounting a `KnowledgeProvider` inside each pane while the app-level provider at
`App.tsx:611` stays mounted for the `/knowledge` route. R7 flagged that arrangement as
the design's least-confident move: two providers bound to the same `sessionId` share the
same `localStorage` keys and the same server-side active-KB state, and may fight. This
spike ran the experiment and answered the question. Nesting is semantically correct; the
shared-key write path in `syncSelection` is not, and that is a live latent bug today,
independent of chat groups.

## Status as of 2026-07-16

**Verdict accepted: GO-WITH-CHANGES. The prerequisite fix is NOT yet made.**

The fix was attempted — resolve the field a writer is not changing from `localStorage`
rather than from its own React closure, in BOTH `setActiveKbId` and `setHiddenKbIds`
(the bug is symmetric, which this spike did not note) — and then **reverted**. The change
was principled, typechecked, and the 14 existing knowledge tests passed with it, but no
regression test could be made to demonstrate it: the provider's server-hydrate effect
(`KnowledgeContext.tsx:187-209`) overwrites BOTH `localStorage` keys from the response
and kept racing the state the test seeds. "Correct by inspection" is not good enough for
a path that POSTs to the server.

Two concrete traps for whoever picks this up — both cost real time:

- The storage keys are `knowledge_active_kb:<id>` and `knowledge_hidden_kbs:<id>`
  (`:14-15`). This spike and the plan both cite `biorouter-knowledge-active-kb:<id>`,
  which **does not exist**.
- The hydrate reads `res.data.active_kb`, NOT `kb_id`. A mock returning `kb_id` hydrates
  to null and silently CLEARS the key, which looks exactly like the bug under test. Make
  `getActive` never settle, to isolate the write path.

**This is a prerequisite for Stage 3 (nested providers), not for Stage 1-2 (tabs, one
group), which never mounts two providers.** It must land with a green, mutation-killed
test before anything nests `KnowledgeProvider`.

> **Note.** The spike's throwaway test file was deleted; the spike left no code

## What the provider owns and fetches

**The plan has the path wrong.** It cites `ui/desktop/src/contexts/KnowledgeContext.tsx`;
the file is at **`ui/desktop/src/components/knowledge/KnowledgeContext.tsx`**. Line
numbers cited in R7 are all correct.

State: `bases` (`:53`), `loading` (`:54`), `activeKbId` (`:57-59`, lazy-init from
`localStorage`), `hiddenKbIds` (`:60-73`), `graphRefreshRef` (`:74`).

Two independent fetches per provider:

- `refresh()` → `listBases` in an effect with `[refresh]` deps (`:130-141`, `:151-153`).
  `refresh` is `useCallback(…, [])`, so **once per mount**.
- `getActive` in the hydrate effect (`:169-213`), deps
  `[hiddenStorageKey, sessionId, storageKey]` → **once per mount, re-runs on `sessionId`
  change**.

**N providers ⇒ N `/knowledge/bases` fetches. No caching, no dedup, no shared
module-level cache.** Measured: 2 providers → `listBases = 2`, `getActive = 2`.
`KnowledgeView.tsx:22-27` confirms the intent ("only fetches the base list once at app
start") — that comment silently becomes false under nesting. This is a cost concern, not
a correctness one.

## The `localStorage` keys and the clobber

**The plan's key name is wrong; the fight is real.**

Actual keys (`:14-23`): **`knowledge_active_kb:<sessionId>`** and
`knowledge_hidden_kbs:<sessionId>` — not `biorouter-knowledge-active-kb:<sessionId>`. No
`biorouter-` prefix, underscores not hyphens.

Both providers **read** (`:57-59`, `:170`) and both **write** (`:80-82` in
`syncSelection`, `:200-202` in hydrate). Definitively:

- **No loop.** Neither provider listens for `storage` events, and the hydrate effect
  (`:169-213`) does not depend on `activeKbId`. A write never re-triggers a read. No
  infinite cycle.
- **No mount-time fight.** Both hydrate from the same server `getActive` and write the
  same value. Idempotent, converges.
- **Yes, a clobber — and it needs no user action to reach the dangerous state.**

The exact chain, **proven** (see "The experiment" below):

1. Pane provider `setActiveKbId('kb2')` → `syncSelection` (`:76-95`) writes
   `localStorage` **and** POSTs `setActive`.
2. The app-level provider **never hears about it** — no storage listener, no re-fetch.
   Its `activeKbId` stays `kb1`. **Silently stale.**
3. **The kill shot is `setHiddenKbIds` (`:104-110`): `syncSelection(activeKbId, nextIds)`
   — it writes `activeKbId` too.** So *any* hidden-KB change in the stale provider writes
   its stale `activeKbId` over `localStorage` **and the server**.
4. Worse, `:161-167` calls `setHiddenKbIds` **automatically** from an effect when `bases`
   changes and hidden ids contain a stale entry. **No user action required.**
   `:155-159` is a second automatic path (`setActiveKbId(null)` on prune).

The pane's in-memory state stays `kb2`, so the UI shows `kb2` while server and
`localStorage` say `kb1` — the user's KB choice silently reverts on next mount, and **the
agent is already running against the wrong KB** (`session_id` is sent at `:87`, so this is
server-side session state, not just cosmetics).

## `useKnowledge` outside a provider

Throws (`:246`). **Blast radius: white screen.** No error boundary wraps
`KnowledgeProvider` at `App.tsx:611`; it sits inside `<Routes>`, so a tree mistake
unmounts the whole router. R7's characterization is correct.

## Consumers and which KB each wants

| Consumer | Wants |
|---|---|
| `BottomMenuKnowledgeSelection.tsx:24` | **per-pane** — the chat's own KB chip |
| `IngestPanel.tsx:27` | **app-level** — `/knowledge` route |
| `KBSelectorPalette.tsx:29` | **app-level** — and it calls `toggleKbHidden`, i.e. **it is the clobber trigger** |
| `KBSelectorTrigger.tsx:14` | app-level |
| `KnowledgeView.tsx:20` | app-level |
| `ChangeLogDrawer.tsx:35` | app-level |
| `KnowledgeGraphPanel.tsx:24` | app-level |
| `useKnowledgeBases.ts:8` | ambiguous — used by both `KBSelectorPalette` and `KnowledgeGraphPanel` (app-level) |

**Exactly one consumer wants the per-pane KB.** Seven want app-level. That asymmetry
drives the recommendation.

## Alternatives considered

- **(a) One app-level provider, re-pointed at the active group's `sessionId`.** Kills the
  clobber by construction (one writer). But a `sessionId` change re-runs `:169-213` →
  every group switch re-fetches `getActive` and rewrites state; and a *background* group's
  `BottomMenuKnowledgeSelection` would display the *active* group's KB. **Wrong
  semantics** — the chip lies about which KB its own chat uses.
- **(b) `sessionId={null}` to the app-level provider while `/pair` is mounted.** R7's own
  hunch. Removes key collision (`:18` falls back to the unsuffixed
  `knowledge_active_kb`), but `/knowledge` then edits *global* KB state while chats edit
  per-session state — two divergent meanings of "active KB", and it couples `App.tsx` to
  route identity. Also `getActive` with no `session_id` (`:190`) returns different server
  state, so `/knowledge` shows a KB unrelated to any chat. **Rejected.**
- **(c) Nest as designed.** Correct semantics — the one consumer that wants per-pane gets
  per-pane, seven get app-level, React's nearest-provider does exactly the right thing.
  **The only defect is the shared-key write path, which is a bug in `syncSelection`, not
  in nesting.**

## Recommendation: adopt (c), plus a mandatory prerequisite fix

Nesting is semantically right and the alternatives are worse. But **(c) is only safe once
`setHiddenKbIds` stops writing `activeKbId`.** Concretely, before Stage 3:

1. **BLOCKING — split the writes.** `syncSelection` (`:76-95`) conflates active-KB and
   hidden-KB writes; `setHiddenKbIds` (`:107`) must not carry `activeKbId`. This is the
   single change that makes two providers on one key non-interfering — and it is worth
   doing on its own merits *today*, independent of chat groups.
2. **Strongly advised — prefer a `storage` listener, or lift `activeKbId` to a shared
   store,** so the stale-read window closes. Without this, the divergence described above
   (pane says `kb2`, `/knowledge` says `kb1`) remains as a *display* inconsistency even
   after the clobber is fixed.
3. **BLOCKING — wrap the pane provider in an error boundary.** The white-screen blast
   radius described under "`useKnowledge` outside a provider" is unacceptable for a
   per-pane provider mounted N times.
4. **Strongly advised — dedup `listBases`** (module-level cache, or lift `bases` to one
   app-level fetch) before allowing more than 2 groups; N panes means N identical fetches
   on every mount.

## The experiment

A throwaway vitest file mounted a nested pair with `sessionId="S1"` against a mocked
`../../api` with simulated server state. The file was **deleted** after the run. Three
experiments, all passed — i.e. every predicted failure reproduced:

```text
[R7] listBases fetches for 2 providers = 2
[R7] getActive  fetches for 2 providers = 2
[R7] after pane setActiveKbId(kb2):
       pane state = kb2   app state = kb1   localStorage = kb2   server = kb2
[R7] after app-level toggleKbHidden(kb1):
       setActive POSTs = [{"kb_id":"kb1","hidden_kbs":["kb1"]}]
       server active = kb1    localStorage = kb1    pane state = kb2
```

Line 3 proves **staleness**: no propagation to the outer provider. Line 5 proves the
**clobber**: a hidden-KB toggle in the app-level provider POSTed `kb_id: "kb1"` —
dragging its stale active KB along — reverting the server and `localStorage` to `kb1`
while the pane still renders `kb2`. **Divergent, silent, and it reaches the server.**

Caveat, disclosed: `Object.keys(localStorage)` printed `["store"]` — an artifact of the
`MemoryStorage` class in `src/test/setup.ts:29-30` (private `store` Map), not a finding.
`getItem` and `setItem` are faithful, so experiments 2 and 3 stand.

## Verdict: GO-WITH-CHANGES

R7's instinct was right to flag this and wrong about the remedy — the fix is **not**
`sessionId={null}` (alternative (b), which trades a clobber for two incompatible meanings
of "active KB"). **Nesting is sound; the shared-key write path is not.** The clobber is a
live latent bug in `syncSelection` that nesting *exposes* rather than *creates* — which is
why fixing it belongs in Stage 0 alongside the `isEventForSession` work already landing,
not in Stage 3. De-risked: R7 can come off the critical path once `setHiddenKbIds` is
decoupled from `activeKbId`.
