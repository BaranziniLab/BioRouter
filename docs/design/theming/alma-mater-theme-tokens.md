# Alma Mater theme tokens

> **What this is.** The colour-token reference for Alma Mater, BioRouter's UCSF-brand theme
> family: the UCSF palette it draws from, the accent decision, a complete token-by-token light
> and dark mapping, and the verified WCAG contrast ratios behind every value.
> **Status:** Current. Approved with the UCSF Teal accent, implemented, and reconciled against
> the shipped code on 2026-07-18 (light-theme revision the same day; originally implemented
> 2026-07-10). **Revised 2026-08-08: the neutrals are no longer Alma Mater's own** — see the
> banner below. §9 records what was actually built.
> **Audience:** developers adding a component that reads colour tokens, and anyone proposing a
> new theme family.

> ## ⚠ Neutrals are shared infrastructure (2026-08-08)
>
> Alma Mater used to carry its own **cool blue-grey** neutral ramp (`#F2F3F4` / `#E1E3E5` /
> `#D1D3D3`) and a navy dark mode all the way down to the page ground. It no longer does. Every
> background, grey, border, focus surface, elevation and scrim is now **one shared set**,
> byte-identical across Parchment, Alma Mater and Roche Limit in both modes, taken from Roche
> Limit's warm-neutral values.
>
> **What the family still owns is what makes it Alma Mater: UCSF Navy as the ink, UCSF Teal as
> the accent, and the UCSF status hues.** The rule and its reasoning are in
> [Theme system architecture §8](theme-system-architecture.md#8--shared-neutrals--one-scaffolding-three-inks).
>
> Every table below has been updated to the shipped values. Where a passage argues *for* a cool
> neutral bias, it is preserved as the record of the original design and marked — it is no longer
> what runs. **Do not reintroduce a per-family grey**; if navy ink fails on a shared ground, retune
> the ink.

Sections are numbered and cited by number from the other theme documents, so the numbering is a
stable reference scheme rather than decoration.

**Owner:** Baranzini Lab, UCSF.
**Companion mockups:** [`alma-mater-light-theme-studio.html`](alma-mater-light-theme-studio.html) (the 2026-07-18 revision — live contrast validation + exportable setup) · [`alma-mater-theme-studio.html`](alma-mater-theme-studio.html) — renders this palette on real BioRouter chrome, in **light + dark**, with a live accent picker that was used to compare the "elegant twist" options before the build. Both are kept as the decision record; the shipped values are in the theme file, not in them.

> This document names the palette, maps every token, and proves the contrast.
> It was written as the pre-build spec and has since been **reconciled against the
> shipped code** — every value below was re-read from the source of truth and every
> ratio recomputed from the hex. The theme-family toggle it proposed is built and
> wired into Appearance settings; see **§9 · as built**.
>
> **Where the theme actually lives now:** one file — [`ui/desktop/themes/alma-mater.theme.mjs`](../../../ui/desktop/themes/alma-mater.theme.mjs).
> The CSS token blocks, the syntax and terminal palettes, the picker entry and the
> boot-splash CSS are all *generated* from it by `npm run themes`, into
> marker-delimited regions of `main.css`, `themes.generated.ts` and `index.html`.
> Do not hand-edit those regions. The re-architecture is described in
> [`theme-system-architecture.md`](theme-system-architecture.md).

## 1 · The theme families

Named theme families, selected independently of light/dark. Three ship today:

| Theme | What it is | Soul |
|---|---|---|
| **Parchment** | The base BioRouter look — warm paper-and-bone neutrals, one terracotta-coral accent. Still the default, and the only family that declares the 17 structural tokens. | Warm, editorial, low-chroma. |
| **Alma Mater** | This document: BioRouter in the **official UCSF brand palette**. | Cool, institutional, navy-anchored — with the **UCSF Teal** C column as the accent. |
| **Roche Limit** | A later family, specified in [`roche-limit-theme.md`](roche-limit-theme.md). | Neutral-warm, orange accent. |

**Alma Mater is a re-colouring, not a re-layout.** It changes colour tokens only. It keeps
BioRouter's entire structure: flat surfaces, hairline borders, dense rows, the two-tone
canvas, the type scale, the motion, and — as the brief required — **the exact same fonts.**

### Constraints honoured

1. **Font unchanged.** `--font-sans` and `--font-mono` stay the current native stacks. UCSF's brand typefaces (Helvetica Neue / Granjon) are **not** adopted. Type scale, weights, tracking — untouched.
2. **Real light *and* real dark.** Alma Mater ships a genuine light variant and a genuine dark variant — four token sets total (Parchment already has two). Not a filter over one mode.
3. **UCSF palette as the source.** Every colour below is drawn from `identity.ucsf.edu/brand-guide` (verified against the live brand guide by the research pass), used with restraint — one accent, colour-as-evidence, never decoration.
4. **Same calm, minimal soul.** The instrument stays quiet. UCSF is the *twist*, not a new instrument.

## 2 · The design thesis

> **Alma Mater = UCSF Navy as the ink + the UCSF Teal C column as the single brand accent, on the shared neutral scaffolding.**

Three ideas do the work:

- **Navy is the ink.** `#052049` (UCSF's "base color") is `--text-default` in light mode and the
  family's whole reading colour. This one move makes the theme read unmistakably as UCSF.

  > **Revised 2026-08-08.** This used to read *"navy is the ground"*, and it meant it: navy
  > anchored ink in light mode **and every dark surface in dark mode**, so where Parchment
  > darkened toward warm umber, Alma Mater darkened toward deep navy. The dark surfaces are now
  > the shared warm-neutral set (`#131312` / `#1b1b19` / `#232320`) and navy survives where it
  > always did most of its work — the ink, plus `text-on-status` and `text-inverse`. The original
  > reasoning is kept here because it explains why the dark palette looks the way it does in the
  > mockups, which no longer match the app.

- **Neutrals are shared, not cool.** *(Revised 2026-08-08.)* The original thesis was that
  Parchment's bone/cream ramp should be replaced by UCSF's cool greys (`#F2F3F4` → `#D1D3D3`)
  with a faint blue cast — "the deliberate opposite bias to Parchment's warmth". That bias is
  gone. All three families now sit on one warm-neutral set, and the deliberate opposition is
  carried entirely by the ink and the accent. The cool greys had cost more than they bought:
  see [architecture §8](theme-system-architecture.md#8--shared-neutrals--one-scaffolding-three-inks).
  `#506380` (I3 Blue-Gray) survives as `--text-muted`, because that is ink.
- **Teal is the accent (revised 2026-07-18).** The single brand accent is UCSF's **Teal "C" column**, stepped by job: **C3 `#16A0AC`** (the named "UCSF Teal") for rails and dots, **C2 `#14828C`** for the CTA fill and links, **C1 `#0E5258`** for hover — lifting to **C4 `#60D0DA`** in dark so it glows on navy. It plays exactly the role terracotta-coral plays in Parchment: primary CTAs, the active-nav rail, live-status dots, **the sidebar nav icons** — and nothing else.

  > The original build used the Violet **G** column (`#6C247C` eggplant → `#C45ED8` orchid), chosen to avoid the corporate-blue cliché. It was replaced because it cost the theme its recognisability: nobody pictures plum when they picture UCSF. Note the honest caveat from the brand research — teal is **not** co-iconic with navy. Navy is the single base colour and UCSF's body ink; teal is one of six peer primary hue ranges and, measured on ucsf.edu, a micro-accent (≈164k px² against navy's 1.8M). Confining it to icons and actions rather than to whole surfaces is the more literal reading of UCSF's one stated colour rule.

**Bonus:** teal keeps its distance from the blue **info** status (`#0F388A`) — the collision the first synthesis had when the accent was CTA-Blue. See §4 for the measured hue separation.

---

## 3 · The UCSF palette we draw from

UCSF codes every colour as **hue-letter + value-number** (letter = hue family, number = value, `1` darkest → `5/6` palest). Row 3 is the "named" core; rows 1–2 are the rich/deep tier; rows 4–5 are the light tints. This *is* UCSF's sanctioned tint ladder — you step the column, you don't invent tints.

The columns Alma Mater actually uses:

| Family | Deep (1–2) | Core (3) | Light (4–5) | Alma Mater uses it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A Navy / Blue** | **A1 `#052049`** (Navy), A2 `#0F388A` | A3 `#006BE9` (CTA), B3 `#178CCB` | B5 `#B8E6FA`, B6 `#E2F4FC` | Ink, chrome, all dark surfaces, **info** |
| **G Violet** | G1 `#461850`, G2 `#6C247C` | G3 `#A238BA` | G4 `#C45ED8`, G5 `#EACCF0` | Syntax `function` (was the accent, to 2026-07-18) |
| **H Magenta** | H1 `#561038`, H2 `#821A56` | H3 `#C42882` | H4 `#E266AE`, H5 `#F2C2DE` | (alt accent option) |
| **F Purple/Periwinkle** | F1 `#2E2872`, F2 `#443E8C` | F3 `#6C62D0` | F4 `#8A8CE3` | (alt accent option) |
| **C Teal** ⭐ | **C1 `#0E5258`**, **C2 `#14828C`** | **C3 `#16A0AC`** | **C4 `#60D0DA`**, C5 `#B4E2E8`, C6 `#E8F6F8` | **The brand accent** — fill, links, rails, nav icons, heatmap |
| **D Green** | D1 `#00483A`, **D2 `#007242`** | D3 `#32A03E` | E3 `#84C234` | **Success**, syntax `string` |
| **L/M/N Alerts** | — | **L3 `#FEB80A`** (Yellow), M3 `#FA6E1E` (Orange), **N3 `#E61048`** (Red) | — | **Warning / Danger** |
| **I/J/K Grays** | I3 `#506380` (Blue-Gray) | J2 `#878D96`, J3 `#B4B9BF` | K3 `#D1D3D3`, J5 `#E1E3E5`, I6 `#F2F3F4` | **Muted / subtle ink**, and the dark-mode near-white |

> The light grey column (K3 / J5 / I6) used to supply this family's **neutral ramp** — the surfaces,
> hovers and hairlines. It no longer does; those are the shared set (§5a). What survives from the UCSF
> greys is **ink**: I3 `#506380` as `--text-muted`, and I6 `#F2F3F4` as the dark-mode `--text-default`.

UCSF also publishes **digital-adjusted** variants for on-screen accessibility (e.g. Interactive Teal `#058488`, hyperlink `#0071AD`). We honour the spirit — every text colour below clears WCAG AA — but the published teal ladder already passes at the steps we use (C2 `#14828C` at 4.56:1 on white, C1 `#0E5258` at 8.87:1), so no digital-adjusted substitute was needed.

> Note: UCSF ships **no dark-theme palette**. Every Alma Mater *dark* value is a contrast-safe extrapolation along UCSF's own hue columns, marked **derived** below and verified to AA.

## 4 · The accent decision (settled)

**Decided 2026-07-18: the UCSF Teal C column.** The options below were previewed live on real
chrome before the call; they are kept as the record of what was weighed.

| Option | Light accent | Dark accent | Character | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **⭐ UCSF Teal (chosen)** | C2 `#14828C` (fill) / C3 `#16A0AC` (rail) | C4 `#60D0DA` | The colour people actually picture beside UCSF navy | white-on-fill **4.56:1** |
| Deep Teal | C1 `#0E5258` | C4 `#60D0DA` | Same column, quieter and far more legible | white-on-fill 8.87:1 |
| CTA Blue | A3 `#006BE9` | derived `#7FC4EE` | UCSF's own documented digital button/link colour — the most literally compliant, and the most generic | white-on-fill 4.91:1 |
| Eggplant *(the original build)* | G2 `#6C247C` | G4 `#C45ED8` | Sophisticated, avoids the blue cliché — but unplaceable as UCSF | white-on-fill 9.63:1 |

**Why Teal over Eggplant:** eggplant was distinctive but not *recognisable*; it made the theme
look like a considered palette rather than like UCSF. Teal is the one saturated hue people
associate with the institution beside navy, and it is verifiably in use on ucsf.edu
(`#16A0AC` as a section band, `#14828C` as text).

**Why Teal over CTA Blue:** A3 is the more literal reading of UCSF's digital guidance and would
be the safer institutional answer. It was passed over because it reads as generic web-blue in a
product whose entire point is that it is *UCSF's* research instrument — and because it collides
with the `info` status hue. Measured: A3 `#006BE9` is **212°**, info A2 `#0F388A` is **220°** —
**8° apart**, indistinguishable as a hue signal. Teal C2 `#14828C` is **185°**, i.e. **35°** off
info. (An earlier draft of this doc claimed 57°; recomputing from the hexes gives 35°. The
conclusion survives — teal is 4× further from info than CTA-Blue is — but the figure was wrong.)

**Where teal is allowed:** primary CTAs, the active-nav rail, live-status dots, links, the
sidebar nav icons, the usage heatmap, and the syntax `type` stop. Nowhere else. The structure
stays neutral grey — which is also what every peer academic-medical design system does.

## 5 · Token-by-token mapping

All values below are **verified to WCAG AA** (computed from the hex; see §6). Geometry, radius,
motion, z-index and shadow *shapes* are **shared with Parchment** — Alma Mater overrides colour only.
Source column: a UCSF code means it's a published swatch; **derived** means a contrast-safe
extrapolation along a UCSF hue column.

### 5a · Two-tone canvas (surfaces)

**All shared.** Not one value in this table is Alma Mater's own — every family paints these.
The `src` column now records the shared ramp position rather than a UCSF swatch, because none
of these came from the UCSF palette any more.

| Token | Light | src | Dark | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--background-canvas` (main panel) | `#FFFFFF` | shared | `#131312` | neutral-950 |
| `--background-app` (window ground) | `#FFFFFF` | shared | `#131312` | neutral-950 |
| `--background-default` / `--card` | `#FFFFFF` | shared | `#1B1B19` | neutral-900 |
| `--background-muted` (panel/terminal ground) | `#F4F4F2` | neutral-100 | `#232320` | shared |
| `--background-code` (code ground) | `#F5F5F3` | shared | `#1B1B19` | neutral-900 |
| `--background-medium` (hover fill) | `#ECECE9` | shared | `#2C2C29` | neutral-800 |
| `--background-strong` (pressed) | `#DCDCD8` | shared | `#3A3A36` | shared |
| `--background-inverse` (tooltip fill) | `#1F1E1C` | shared | `#EDEDEA` | shared |
| `--background-focus` (surface shift) | `#E0E0DC` | shared | `#35342F` | shared |

> **`--background-canvas` is not `--background-app`.** `--background-app` is the
> *window* ground — what `body` paints, behind everything. `--background-canvas` is
> what the main panel actually paints: the conversation, the hub and every
> top-level view. They hold the same value in the shared set, but they are separate
> tokens because they mean separate things — see
> [architecture §5](theme-system-architecture.md#--background-canvas-is-not---background-app).
> Light mode is still the two-tone canvas of the mockups: a **white** panel against the
> `#F7F7F5` sidebar. (Before this token existed the panel painted `--background-muted` and the
> whole canvas read grey, which is the bug the separation fixes.)
>
> **Dark no longer inverts the ladder.** Alma Mater dark used to put the canvas `#0D2A50`
> *above* its cards `#08213F`, so the navy page lifted and cards recessed into it, and this
> document previously pinned that as "the shipped, preferred appearance — not a drift waiting to
> be corrected". The shared set runs the other way (canvas darkest, cards a step up) and a single
> neutral set cannot carry two contradictory orders. This is the largest visible change of the
> 2026-08-08 unification, and it was made deliberately, not by drift.

> **`--background-inverse` is no longer this family's navy.** It used to be `#052049` in light —
> each family set the tooltip fill to its own `--text-default`. A tooltip is a *surface*, so it
> is shared; Alma Mater still places its own `--text-inverse` (white in light, navy in dark) on it.

> **`--background-code` is not always `--background-muted`.** In light they are one unit apart
> (`#F5F5F3` vs `#F4F4F2`); in dark, code sits on the card ground `#1B1B19` while the page ground
> is a step lighter at `#232320`. The syntax palette in §5g is measured against
> `--background-code`; the terminal in §5j is grounded on `--background-muted` in **both** modes.
> The two are genuinely different surfaces and the contract records that rather than assuming
> they agree.

### 5b · Sidebar (the two-tone signature)

One calm step deeper than the canvas — same restraint as Parchment's sidebar (a *slightly deeper surface*, never a dark slab). The colour on the sidebar is carried by the **accent rail on the active item** and by `--sidebar-icon`, not by tinting the whole surface. The greys are shared; the two coloured rows are Alma Mater's.

| Token | Light | src | Dark | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--sidebar` | `#F7F7F5` | shared | `#171716` | shared |
| `--sidebar-hover` | `#EFEFEC` | shared | `#232320` | shared |
| `--sidebar-active` | `#EAEAE6` | shared | `#2E2E2A` | shared |
| `--sidebar-icon` | `#14828C` | **C2 — this family's** | `#60D0DA` | **C4 — this family's** |
| `--sidebar-border` | `#E7E7E3` | shared | `#2A2A27` | shared |
| `--sidebar-foreground` | `#052049` | **=text-default** | `#F2F3F4` | **=text-default** |
| `--sidebar-primary` | =`--background-accent` | | =`--background-accent` | |

> The alternative — a **navy sidebar even in light mode**, UCSF's most recognizable move — was previewed in the mockup and **not taken** (§7.2): most on-brand, but the biggest departure from Parchment's layout feel.

### 5c · Accent — one hue (UCSF Teal)

| Token | Light | src | Dark | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--background-accent` (button fill) | `#14828C` | C2 | `#60D0DA` | C4 |
| `--background-accent-hover` | `#0E5258` | C1 | `#8AE0E8` | derived (→C4 light) |
| `--text-on-accent` (ink on fill) | `#FFFFFF` | White | `#052049` | Navy |
| `--border-accent` | `#14828C` | C2 | `#60D0DA` | C4 |
| `--text-accent` (links, coloured labels) | `#14828C` | C2 | `#60D0DA` | C4 |
| `--accent-bar` (rails / dots / underline) | `#16A0AC` | C3 "UCSF Teal" | `#60D0DA` | C4 |
| `--sidebar-icon` (nav icons) | `#14828C` | C2 | `#60D0DA` | C4 |

> **Why the ladder splits three ways.** C3 is the *named* UCSF Teal but is only **3.15:1 on white**, so it can never be text or a filled button — it is rails and dots. C2 is the lightest official teal that clears AA with white ink (**4.56:1**), so it takes the fill and the links. C1 (**8.87:1**) takes hover. UCSF quotes C3 at 5.08:1 — and it does compute to **5.09:1**, but **against navy**, not white. Copying that figure across grounds would have shipped an inaccessible link colour.

### 5d · Text hierarchy

| Token | Light | src | Dark | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--text-default` | `#052049` | Navy | `#F2F3F4` | I6 |
| `--text-muted` | `#506380` | I3 Blue-Gray | `#B4B9BF` | J3 |
| `--text-subtle` | `#586780` | derived (kept ≥5:1) | `#909AA6` | derived |
| `--text-inverse` | `#FFFFFF` | White | `#052049` | Navy |

### 5e · Borders

**All shared** — borders and the focus affordances are neutral scaffolding, and the ring was
always explicitly neutral rather than accent-coloured, so unifying it changed nothing about its
intent. Note that `--ring` and `--border-focus` used to be Alma Mater's blue-greys (`#506380`,
`#586780`); those hexes survive in §5d as `--text-muted` and `--text-subtle`, which is ink.

| Token | Light | src | Dark | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--border-subtle` (hairline default) | `#E4E4E0` | neutral-200 | `#302F2C` | shared |
| `--border-strong` (hover / emphasis) | `#D2D2CD` | neutral-300 | `#3E3D39` | neutral-700 |
| `--border-input` (control edge) | `#C9C9C3` | shared | `#4A4945` | shared |
| `--ring` / focus (neutral, high-contrast mode only) | `#5C5A55` | neutral-600 | `#A5A39D` | shared |
| `--border-focus` | `#6B6963` | shared | `#9C9A93` | shared |

> **Focus stays a neutral surface shift, never the accent** — exactly as Parchment does it (design.md D-15). A saturated teal outline on every focused field would read as an alarm on a calm surface. `--background-focus` deepens the control's own fill by one neutral step.
>
> House rule on the focus surface: **`text-default` must clear AA on it, `text-subtle` need not.**
> On the shared focus fill `#E0E0DC`, Alma light is `text-default` **12.12:1** and `text-subtle`
> **4.33:1** — the latter improved from 3.92:1 on the old cool fill but is still under 4.5, and the
> contrast guard deliberately does not assert that pair. Forcing it would mean moving the hover
> fill and flattening the muted/medium ramp.

### 5f · Status (fill vs text/icon, split per Parchment)

Light mode uses UCSF's accessible dark stops; dark mode uses lighter tints with navy ink — mirroring Parchment's authored-twice discipline. Ink on fills = `--text-on-status` (white in light, navy `#052049` in dark).

| Role | Light fill | Light text/icon | Dark fill | Dark text/icon | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Danger** | `#E61048` | `#C40D3E` | `#F5768A` | `#F5768A` | N3 Red / derived |
| **Success** | `#007242` | `#007242` | `#5FBF74` | `#5FBF74` | D2 Green / derived |
| **Warning** | `#8A5A00` | `#8A5A00` | `#FEB80A` (navy ink) | `#FEB80A` | derived amber / L3 |
| **Info** | `#0F388A` | `#0F388A` | `#7FB3E6` | `#7FB3E6` | A2 Blue / derived |

Each role also carries a **border** token, so a status card's edge is not a generic hairline.
In Alma these track the text/icon stop exactly — the border is the same ink as the label:

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `--border-danger` | `#C40D3E` (=text-danger) | `#F5768A` |
| `--border-success` | `#007242` (=text-success) | `#5FBF74` |
| `--border-warning` | `#8A5A00` (=text-warning) | `#FEB80A` |
| `--border-info` | `#0F388A` (=text-info) | `#7FB3E6` |

> Note the light **warning fill is `#8A5A00`, not `#FEB80A`.** UCSF's L3 yellow cannot carry
> white ink at any size, so light mode uses the derived dark amber for the fill *and* the text,
> and only dark mode gets to use L3 itself (with navy ink). `--text-on-status` is white in
> light, navy `#052049` in dark.

### 5g · Code syntax palette (generated into `themes.generated.ts`, consumed by `codeTheme.ts`)

Recoloured to UCSF families; every stop ≥4.5:1 on its code ground — the **shared** `--background-code`, light `#F5F5F3` and dark `#1B1B19` (they were this family's own `#F2F3F4` / `#08213F` until 2026-08-08; the tightest stops now measure 5.25 light and 5.59 dark, both improved). **`type/class` is the accent hue** — C1 Teal `#0E5258` in light, `#5CC6D0` in dark — tying code to the accent. The **eggplant survives as `function`** (G2 `#6C247C`), the one place the original violet accent still earns its keep. Diff rows reuse status danger/success, as Parchment does.

| Prism role | Light | src | Dark | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| plain (var / prop) | `#052049` | Navy | `#E1E3E5` | J5 |
| comment | `#586780` | derived | `#8A93A6` | derived |
| keyword (600) | `#0F388A` | A2 Blue | `#7FB3E6` | derived |

### 5h · Usage heatmap (sequential)

Parchment uses a warm terracotta ramp; Alma Mater uses UCSF's own teal ladder — monotonic in
luminance so the five steps read in order even in greyscale. **Level 0 is shared**: it is the
empty-day fill, a grey a shade off the page rather than a step on the accent ramp, so it belongs
to the scaffolding. Levels 1–4 are the family's.

| Level | Light | Dark | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (idle) | `#EEEEEA` | `#1E1D1B` | shared |
| 1 | `#B4E2E8` (C5) | `#0E5258` | teal ramp |
| 2 | `#60D0DA` (C4) | `#14828C` | teal ramp |
| 3 | `#16A0AC` (C3) | `#16A0AC` | teal ramp |
| 4 | `#0E5258` (C1) | `#60D0DA` | teal ramp |

### 5i · Shadows and the scrim

**Shared, as of 2026-08-08.** Same four elevation shapes as always, and now the same tint too:
every alpha is cast in the shared near-black `rgba(31,30,28,…)` in light, black in dark. Alma
Mater used to cast its light-mode shadows and its scrim in **navy `rgba(5,32,73,…)`**; a
full-screen navy backdrop is a *background*, and backgrounds no longer vary by family. The
flat-by-default rule is unchanged.

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `--scrim` (modal / diagnostics overlay) | `rgba(31, 30, 28, 0.18)` | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.48)` |

> **`--scrim` is a token, and it stays one.** The modal and diagnostics overlays used to be a
> hardcoded `rgba(32,25,15,0.18)` — Parchment's warm brown — sitting *outside* the token layer,
> with a single hand-written rule retinting Alma Mater light. Roche Limit, added afterwards,
> therefore silently wore Parchment's brown scrim over its own neutral-warm surfaces. The token
> is what stopped that, and it is kept even though all three families now declare the same value:
> a future family that genuinely needs its own tint re-points one name instead of finding two
> rules. `main.css` reads `background: var(--scrim)` at the one use site.

### 5j · Terminal ANSI-16 (`InAppTerminalDock`)

xterm paints to a canvas and cannot read `var()`, so the terminal needs its own literal palette.
The ANSI stops are **this family's ink** and stay UCSF-hued; the ground under them is shared.
`terminalGround` is `--background-muted` in both modes — **now the same declaration in all three
families** (light `#F4F4F2`, dark `#232320`). It stays declared per family rather than hardcoded
in the generator, because the point was that the choice be written down and measured, and that
holds when the answer agrees. `background` and `cursorAccent` are **derived** from that ground
and must not be authored.

Ratios below are against each mode's own ground, recomputed from the hexes after the ground moved.
The dark column improved across the board: the shared `#232320` is darker than the navy `#0D2A50`
it replaced.

| Slot | Light | | Dark | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `foreground` | `#052049` | 14.56 | `#E1E3E5` | 12.25 |
| `cursor` | `#0E5258` | 8.06 | `#8AE0E8` | 10.44 |
| `selectionBackground` | `#D8D9DA` | 1.28 † | `#163864` | 1.34 † |
| `black` | `#052049` | 14.56 † | `#1E477F` | 1.70 † |
| `red` | `#C40D3E` | 5.49 | `#F5768A` | 5.88 |
| `green` | `#007242` | 5.47 | `#5FBF74` | 6.90 |
| `yellow` | `#8A5A00` | 5.38 | `#FEB80A` | 9.06 |
| `blue` | `#0F388A` | 9.76 | `#7FB3E6` | 7.12 |
| `magenta` | `#6C247C` | 8.74 | `#C58AD6` | 5.99 |
| `cyan` | `#0E5258` | 8.06 | `#5CC6D0` | 7.84 |
| `white` | `#506380` | 5.55 | `#B4B9BF` | 7.98 |
| `brightBlack` | `#586780` | 5.20 | `#909AA6` | 5.52 |
| `brightRed` | `#D0143F` | 4.95 | `#FF8FA0` | 7.27 |
| `brightGreen` | `#1F7A3D` | 4.88 | `#7FD08F` | 8.49 |
| `brightYellow` | `#8A5A00` | 5.38 | `#FFCA4A` | 10.35 |
| `brightBlue` | `#255FB5` | 5.64 | `#A3C9F0` | 9.13 |
| `brightMagenta` | `#8A1FA0` | 6.85 | `#D7A5E8` | 7.83 |
| `brightCyan` | `#106A72` | 5.73 | `#7FD8E0` | 9.61 |
| `brightWhite` | `#052049` | 14.56 | `#F2F3F4` | 14.18 |

> `selectionBackground` is deliberately still **this family's own** cool grey `#D8D9DA` (and navy
> `#163864` in dark) rather than a shared neutral. The terminal's selection wash sits beside the
> `cursor`, which is per family for the same reason: both are affordances the family tints, not
> app chrome. Neither carries a contrast floor.

† Exempt by contract, with the reason recorded: `selectionBackground` is a surface, not a
foreground (floor 1.0); ANSI `black` is a dim slot — a lifted ground by convention, not text
(floor 1.0). Bright slots carry a documented **3:1** floor rather than 4.5, because on a light
ground "bright" (lighter than its base) and "AA" are in direct conflict. **Alma happens to clear
4.5:1 on every non-exempt slot in both modes anyway** — the tightest are light `brightGreen`
4.88 and dark `brightBlack` 5.52 — so it never actually spends that relaxation.

### 5k · Raw palette remap

Beyond the 62 semantic tokens, the light block re-declares **27 raw palette primitives**
(`--color-coral-*`, `--color-neutral-*`, `--color-red/blue/green/yellow-*`). These are
**mode-independent by design** — declared once in the light block and inherited by dark — and
they exist only to catch components that reach *past* the semantic layer and use a
`neutral-500` / `coral-600` utility directly. Without them, a stray direct usage would keep
Parchment's warm bias inside an otherwise cool theme. The semantic layer stays authoritative.

The coral ramp is remapped straight onto the teal ladder: `coral-400` → `#60D0DA` (C4),
`coral-500` → `#16A0AC` (C3), `coral-600` → `#14828C` (C2), `coral-700` → `#0E5258` (C1). That
remap is the whole point of this block and is unaffected by the unification.

**The neutral half of the remap is now a no-op.** It used to run cool grey at the light end
(`#F7F8F9` → `#D1D3D3`) and turn navy at the dark end (`#3A4A66` → `#04142E`); it now restates
the shared ramp (`#FAFAF9` → `#F4F4F2` → `#E4E4E0` → `#D2D2CD` → … → `#131312`) verbatim,
identical to the base `@theme` block and to Roche Limit's. It is kept only because the contract
requires every non-base family to declare the full raw palette, which is what lets a guard resolve
a family in isolation. There is nothing family-specific left in those eleven values — if you are
looking for what makes Alma Mater cool, it is §5d, not here.

### 5l · Boot splash

The pre-React splash paints before any of this exists, so `index.html` carries its own
per-family block (`html[data-theme='alma-mater'] #br-boot`). It is generated from the theme
file's `splash` values; `--br-bg` is **derived** from `--background-muted`.

| Splash var | Light | Dark | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--br-bg` | `#F4F4F2` (derived from `--background-muted`) | `#232320` (derived) | shared |
| `--br-navy` | `#052049` | `#18A3AC` | this family's |
| `--br-coral` | `#16A0AC` | `#16A0AC` | this family's |
| `--br-track` | `#E4E4E0` | `#302F2C` | shared |

> **The ground and the track are shared; only the two inks are Alma Mater's.** That is the whole
> unification in miniature — every family's splash paints the same `#F4F4F2` / `#232320` and is
> told apart by its mark. `--br-track` used to be Parchment's bone `#E8E1D2` in both modes for
> every family (a leftover, not a decision); it is now the shared `--border-subtle`, which is
> what a progress track should be.

> **The splash coral was wrong until the 2026-07-18 pass.** Alma Mater inherited Parchment's
> terracotta `#B85A32`, so the boot mark flashed warm orange for the whole backend-startup window
> and then jumped to teal on hydration. It is now the accent bar's own `#16A0AC` — **2.86:1** on
> the light splash ground and **5.00:1** on the dark one. The light figure sits just under the
> 3:1 that SC 1.4.11 asks of non-text UI, which is acceptable here only because the mark is a
> **logotype**, explicitly exempted by that success criterion — it is brand artwork, not an
> interface control, and nothing is actionable during the splash. The generator asserts the
> *navy* half at 3:1 (light **14.56**, dark **5.16**), which is the half that carries the mark's
> readable structure.

Every ratio in this table improved when the ground moved off navy — the shared neutrals are
darker than the navy surfaces they replaced, so the same navy-family inks sit on more contrast.

## 7 · The five decisions — settled

These were the open questions when this doc was step 1. All five are now decided and shipped;
the alternatives are kept as the record of what was weighed.

1. **Accent hue → UCSF Teal.** The original recommendation here was **Eggplant** (G2 `#6C247C`),
   with Magenta / Periwinkle / CTA-Blue as the other live options. Overturned on 2026-07-18 for
   the reasons in §4: eggplant was distinctive but not *recognisable* as UCSF. The eggplant is
   retained in exactly one place — the syntax `function` stop (§5g).
2. **Sidebar treatment → two-tone, not a slab.** Calm, matches Parchment's discipline. The
   navy light-mode sidebar (most on-brand, biggest departure) was previewed and passed over.
   *Amended 2026-08-08:* the two-tone survives, the cool grey does not — the sidebar is now the
   shared neutral, and the accent lives on the icons and the active rail (§5b).
3. **Dark-surface base → navy.** *Superseded 2026-08-08.* A plum-tinted dark was the alternative
   when the accent was eggplant; with a teal accent it was moot, and every dark surface became a
   navy step. Dark surfaces are now the shared warm-neutral set and navy is ink only (§5a). This
   was the most consequential thing the unification took from this family, and it was taken
   knowingly: a shared scaffolding is worth more than three separately-tuned dark grounds.
   See [architecture §8](theme-system-architecture.md#8--shared-neutrals--one-scaffolding-three-inks).
4. **How far the extended spectrum reaches → data-viz and syntax only.** Teal/green/magenta
   never become general UI chrome, which is what protects the one-accent rule.
5. **Default theme → Parchment.** Alma Mater is opt-in via the Appearance theme-family selector.
   Parchment also remains the **base** family in the generator's sense: it alone supplies the
   bare `:root` / `.dark` blocks and the 17 structural tokens (radii, motion, z-index) that no
   theme may vary.

---

## 8 · The original implementation plan (kept for reference)

This was the step-2 plan. It held up — the theme system was already token-driven, so Alma Mater
landed with *zero component changes* — but the file list is now historical: several of these
sites are generated rather than hand-edited. See §9 for what the code looks like today.

- **`main.css`** — add `:root[data-theme='alma-mater']` (light) and `.dark[data-theme='alma-mater']` (dark) blocks that re-declare **only the colour tokens** above. Specificity `(0,2,0)` beats bare `:root`/`.dark` without touching them. Add `--color-alma-*` primitives beside `--color-coral-*`.
- **`codeTheme.ts`** — add an Alma Mater light/dark syntax set; select it by theme family.
- **`ThemeContext.tsx`** — add a `themeFamily: 'parchment' | 'alma-mater'` axis (localStorage-persisted), write `data-theme` on `<html>` alongside the existing `.dark`/`.light` class, broadcast across windows like the mode already is.
- **`index.html`** — mirror the family in the pre-hydration script so it doesn't flash on load.
- **Appearance settings** — mount a small **theme-family selector** (Parchment | Alma Mater) beside the existing light/dark control in [`AppSettingsSection.tsx`](../../../ui/desktop/src/components/settings/app/AppSettingsSection.tsx). The existing [`ThemeSelector`](../../../ui/desktop/src/components/BioRouterSidebar/ThemeSelector.tsx) is generalised or paired with a new `ThemeFamilySelector`.
- **Contrast guard** — extend `scripts/check-contrast.mjs` to assert Alma Mater's pairs too, so a future edit can't regress it.

Two things the plan got wrong, both found by running the real gate rather than reasoning about
the token layer: the primitives were **not** added as a parallel `--color-alma-*` set — they
**remap the existing `--color-coral-*` / `--color-neutral-*` names in place** (§5k), which is
what actually catches components reaching past the semantic layer. And the plan had no line for
the boot splash, which is why Alma flashed Parchment terracotta for months (§5l).

---

## 9 · Implementation — as built

Shipped, then **re-architected on 2026-07-18**. The theme is no longer a pattern of edits spread
across nine files; it is **one file plus one command**.

### Where Alma Mater lives now

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source of truth** | [`ui/desktop/themes/alma-mater.theme.mjs`](../../../ui/desktop/themes/alma-mater.theme.mjs) — 62 semantic tokens × 2 modes, 27 raw remaps, 10 syntax stops × 2, 19 terminal stops × 2, 3 splash values, plus `id` / `label` / `swatch` / `terminalGround`. |
| **Command** | `npm run themes` regenerates; `npm run themes -- --check` fails CI if anything is stale. It runs inside `npm run lint:check`. |
| **Contract** | `ui/desktop/scripts/lib/theme-contract.mjs` — the written-down answer to "what does a theme have to define?". A missing token means the generator **refuses to emit**. |

### What is generated from it

| Target | Region | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `src/styles/main.css` | marker-delimited | `:root[data-theme='alma-mater']` — **89 declarations** (62 semantic + 27 raw); `.dark[data-theme='alma-mater']` — **62**. Dark must follow light: the two tie at specificity `(0,2,0)` and dark wins on source order alone. |
| `src/styles/themes.generated.ts` | whole file | Syntax palette, terminal palette, `codeGround`, `terminalGround`, brand-mark colours, and the family manifest (`THEME_FAMILY_IDS`, label, swatch). |
| `index.html` | marker-delimited | The pre-hydration `FAMILIES` allow-list and the two boot-splash blocks. |

`ThemeContext.tsx`, `ThemeFamilySelector.tsx`, `codeTheme.ts` and `InAppTerminalDock.tsx` now all
**import** from `themes.generated.ts` instead of holding their own copies. `THEME_FAMILIES` is
literally `THEME_FAMILY_IDS`. The three duplicated family lists the old architecture carried are
gone.

### Values that are DERIVED and must not be authored

The generator computes these, because they are exactly the ones that used to live in two-to-four
places and silently drift:

| Derived value | From |
|---|---|
| `terminal.background`, `terminal.cursorAccent` | the family's own `terminalGround` token — Alma: `--background-muted`, both modes |
| code ground (`CODE_BG`) | `--background-code` |
| splash `--br-bg` | `--background-muted` |

Authoring `terminal.background` by hand is a validation error, not a silent override. This matters
because the three families **genuinely disagree** about which token the terminal dock paints —
Parchment-dark grounds on `--background-code`, Alma and Roche on `--background-muted`. A generator
that hardcoded one answer would have re-grounded two terminals under ANSI palettes tuned for a
different surface.

### Corrections this pass folded in

- **`--scrim` promoted to a token** (§5i). The overlay was a hardcoded warm-brown `rgba()` outside
  the token layer with a one-off Alma override; Roche Limit consequently wore Parchment's scrim.
- **Alma's boot-splash coral fixed** from Parchment's terracotta `#B85A32` to `#16A0AC` (§5l).
- **`--background-code` and `--sidebar-icon` written down here for the first time.** Both shipped
  long before this doc mentioned them; `--sidebar-icon` is the token that actually carries "teal
  nav icons", which §5c had been describing without naming.

### The 2026-08-08 neutral unification

- Alma Mater's cool blue-grey ramp and its navy dark surfaces were replaced by the shared
  neutral set (§5a, §5b, §5e, §5k), and its navy-tinted shadows and scrim by the shared
  near-black ones (§5i). `background-inverse`, `heat-0` and the splash track moved with them.
- **No ink or accent changed.** Navy, teal and the UCSF status hues are untouched — the family
  reads as itself for the same reasons it always did.
- **No contrast assertion regressed.** Alma Mater needed no retuning at all: every ratio held or
  improved, because the shared dark surfaces are darker than the navy ones they replaced. (The
  one family that did need a repair was Parchment, whose terminal `yellow` and `cyan` were tuned
  against its own cream dock ground.)
- One measured pair is *worse* and is recorded rather than hidden: `--text-subtle` on the focus
  fill went from 3.92:1 to 4.33:1 — an improvement, but still the pair the guard deliberately
  does not assert (§5e).

### Verification performed

- `node scripts/check-contrast.mjs` — **330/330 assertions pass** across three families × two
  modes. The guard discovers scopes by sweeping `main.css` for `[data-theme='…']`, so a new
  family is audited with zero edits to it. (Re-measure this count rather than quoting it: it
  grows whenever an assertion is added, and it was 324 before the canvas/muted step was guarded.)
- `node scripts/generate-themes.mjs --check` — generated artifacts current across all 3 themes.
- Every ratio in §5j and §6 recomputed from the shipped hexes with the WCAG relative-luminance
  formula, against the token each value is actually painted on.
