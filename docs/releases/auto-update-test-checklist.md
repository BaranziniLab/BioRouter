# Auto-update test checklist

> **What this is.** The verification plan for the one-click "Restart & Update" flow on macOS and the assisted-download fallback on Windows and Linux. It has two parts: a frozen record of the tests already executed (Section A), and an unrun checklist to work through for each release (Sections B–H).
> **Status:** Current. Sections B–H are the live pre-release QA script for auto-update; Section A is a completed evidence log frozen at the 1.86.0 release cycle, with the most recent entry executed 2026-07-14.
> **Audience:** maintainers cutting a release.
>
> **Identifier key.** Section letters A–H are referenced by other sections of this file ("see Section A", "Sections B/C below") — keep them when editing. In Sections B–H, **`X`** is the throwaway test release you cut, and **`X-1`** is the older build already installed on the test machine.

BioRouter's updater replaces the old "open the download page, grab the DMG, drag it into Applications, quit the app" experience with a one-click **Restart & Update** button driven by `electron-updater`. On macOS the app swaps itself in place and relaunches; on Windows and Linux the app auto-downloads the installer and guides the user through it. This checklist exists because the final in-place swap can only be proven on a signed and notarized build running on real hardware, so a portion of the verification cannot be automated in CI.

## What changed

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Startup "update available" modal | Opened `biorouter.ucsf.edu/download` in a browser | Listens to `electron-updater` events; background-downloads; shows a **Restart & Update** button that quits + installs + relaunches in one click |
| Settings → Check for Updates | Opened the GitHub release page | Drives the same `electron-updater` pipeline with progress + one-click install |
| Release artifacts | 7 (5 GUI + 2 CLI) | 11 — 5 GUI + 2 CLI + the headless Linux tarball + `Biorouter-darwin-arm64-{ver}.zip`, `Biorouter-darwin-x64-{ver}.zip`, and `latest-mac.yml` for in-place macOS updates |
| Dependency / CLI checks | unchanged | **unchanged** (DependencySetupModal "Biorouter CLI Update" card behaves exactly as before) |
| User config / sessions / extensions | preserved | **preserved** (live in `~/.config/biorouter`, never touched by app replacement) |

Files touched:
`ui/desktop/src/utils/updaterState.ts` (new pure reducer),
`ui/desktop/src/utils/autoUpdater.ts` (richer persisted state),
`ui/desktop/src/preload.ts` (disposer + wider state type),
`ui/desktop/src/components/UpdateAvailableModal.tsx`,
`ui/desktop/src/components/settings/app/UpdateSection.tsx`,
`ui/desktop/scripts/generate-update-manifests.js` (new),
[`scripts/release.sh`](../../scripts/release.sh) (`mac-manifest` phase + publish/verify wiring).

## Platform support matrix

| Platform | One-click in-place auto-update? | Mechanism |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| **macOS arm64** | ✅ Yes | Squirrel.Mac via signed zip + `latest-mac.yml`; symlinked terminal `biorouter` auto-updates because it points into the in-place-replaced `.app` bundle |
| **macOS x64 (Intel)** | ✅ Yes | same, x64 zip |
| **Windows** | ⚠️ Assisted | plain `.zip` has no electron-updater installer; auto-downloads to `~/Downloads`, guided install. Terminal `biorouter` re-link via the existing CLI card |
| **Linux (.deb/.rpm)** | ⚠️ Assisted | no electron-updater in-place installer; auto-downloads installer, guided install |

> **Note.** The user's primary platform is macOS, where the full one-click experience is
> delivered. Windows and Linux keep the improved assisted-download flow (still
> better than "open a web page").

## Section A — executed evidence

Everything in this section has been run and recorded. The ticked boxes are a
historical record, not a to-do list — re-run the commands rather than trusting
the ticks if you need current numbers.

### Automated tests

All of the following were run and are green (48 automated tests + 3 production
bundle builds). They cover the state machine, the actual React UI wiring, the
**real electron-updater parser/arch-selection**, the manifest generator, and a
full Electron bundle build — i.e. everything except the irreducible "click the
button on a physically notarized app" step (Section B/C, which needs Apple
notarization creds + real hardware).

- [x] `npx vitest run src/utils/updaterState.test.ts` — **23** unit tests: reducer, version compare, snapshot recovery, monotonic progress, sticky-downloaded, error handling.
- [x] `npx vitest run src/components/UpdateAvailableModal.test.tsx` — **7** component-integration tests: renders nothing until an event; progress bar → one-click **Restart & Update** button → clicking it calls `installUpdate()`; pre-mount recovery via `getUpdateState`; "Later" records dismissal; error state shows no fake install button; a post-download error doesn't hide the install button; dismissed-version is not re-prompted.
- [x] `npx vitest run src/components/settings/app/UpdateSection.test.tsx` — **5** component-integration tests: current version shown; **Check for Updates** drives `electron-updater` → progress → one-click **Restart & Update to X** calls `installUpdate()`; up-to-date; error surfaced; ready-to-install recovered on a freshly opened panel.
- [x] `node scripts/generate-update-manifests.test.js` — **7** generator tests: base64 SHA-512, both-arch listing, arch-token distinguishability, YAML shape, single-arch, error cases.
- [x] `node scripts/electron-updater-compat.test.js` — **6** integration tests against the **real** `electron-updater` code (`parseUpdateInfo` / `resolveFiles` / `findFile` from `node_modules`): our `latest-mac.yml` parses into a valid `UpdateInfo`; GitHub asset URLs resolve correctly; an **arm64 client selects the arm64 zip** and an **Intel client the x64 zip** via MacUpdater's exact arch filter; every selected file carries the sha512 electron-updater verifies; a tampered checksum is detectable.
- [x] `node scripts/run-live-update-e2e.js` — **LIVE end-to-end inside a real Electron 39.8.10 process** driving the real `electron-updater` engine against a locally-served release built from our generator. Proven for real: (a) **valid** path — `checking-for-update` → `update-available` (version parsed from our `latest-mac.yml`) → real `download-progress` to 100% → **`update-downloaded`**, which is the exact event that flips the one-click **Restart & Update** button on; (b) **tampered** path — a corrupted served zip is **rejected with `sha512 checksum mismatch`** and never reaches the installable state. This executes the entire update pipeline up to — but not including — the final `quitAndInstall` OS swap (the only step that needs a notarized signature; see below).
- [x] `npm run typecheck` — clean.
- [x] `npx eslint <all changed + test files> --max-warnings 0` — clean.
- [x] `npx vite build -c vite.renderer.config.mts` **and** `-c vite.main.config.mts` **and** `-c vite.preload.config.mts` — all three Electron bundles build with the new code (renderer + main-process `autoUpdater.ts` + `preload.ts`).
- [x] `bash -n scripts/release.sh` — syntax OK.
- [x] Manifest sanity against the real built zips in `out/make/zip/darwin/*`: each `sha512` equals `openssl dgst -sha512 -binary <zip> | base64`, and each `maker-zip` contains `Biorouter.app/` + `Contents/_CodeSignature` at the archive root (Squirrel.Mac requirement).

> **Note.** Pre-existing baseline: the repo has **32 Vitest failures unrelated to this
> work** (e.g. `LeadWorkerSettings`, `DashboardProvider`, `App.test.tsx`),
> identical on the clean tree (`git stash -u` → run → compare). This branch adds
> 35 passing Vitest tests and **0 new failures** (359→394 passed, 32→32 failed).
>
> _Snapshot taken at the time of that release; the names above are what was
> actually observed then. `DashboardProvider` and `App.test.tsx` no longer exist
> (dashboard mode was removed on 2026-07-18 — see the
> [dashboard mode removal record](../history/dashboard-mode/README.md)) — left
> unedited because rewriting a recorded measurement would falsify it. Re-measure
> rather than read these as current._

### Live notarized swap — the full one-click update, end-to-end

The complete one-click update — including the macOS Squirrel.Mac in-place swap
of a **signed + notarized** build, the step previously called out as
hardware/credential-gated — has now been **executed and passes**.

Procedure (scripted by [`ui/desktop/scripts/notarized-swap-test.sh`](../../ui/desktop/scripts/notarized-swap-test.sh)):

1. Built two real apps under hermit Node 24 (reusing the arm64 Rust backend):
   **N = 1.86.0 signed + notarized + stapled** (the update payload) and
   **O = 1.85.5 signed** (UCSF identity, the app under test). Both verified:
   `codesign --verify --deep --strict` ok, UCSF Developer ID → Apple Root CA
   chain; N's `xcrun stapler validate` = "The validate action worked!".
2. Generated `latest-mac.yml` from N's zip and served N + manifest over local
   HTTP (electron-updater's generic-feed layout).
3. Launched O pointed at that feed (sandboxed `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, isolated
   `--user-data-dir`, so the user's real install/config is untouched).
4. Observed, from O's own log: `Update feed override active` → `Checking for
   update` → update found → handed to **native Squirrel.Mac**
   (`…requested by Squirrel.Mac, pipe …Biorouter-darwin-arm64-1.86.0.zip`;
   `Download completed to …com.electron.biorouter.ShipIt/update…`) → app quit
   and the on-disk bundle **swapped 1.85.5 → 1.86.0**.
5. Verified the swapped bundle: version **1.86.0**, UCSF-signed, **stapler
   validate passes** (notarized), arm64 backend.

Result line: `PASS: notarized in-place auto-update swap succeeded (1.85.5 -> 1.86.0)`.

This exercises exactly the user-facing flow: an installed older build detects a
newer release, downloads the notarized app, and — on the one-click install —
Squirrel.Mac validates the notarized signature and swaps the app in place, then
relaunches on the new version. Settings/config are preserved (the swap replaces
only the bundle; `~/.config/biorouter` is untouched).

Notes and gotchas captured while executing this:

- **Build under hermit Node 24**, not Homebrew Node 26 — the packager silently
  no-ops (event loop empties, exit 0, no app) under Node 26.
- **`src/bin` must hold the macOS arm64 backend**, not the Linux ELF binaries a
  prior Linux release leaves behind (`just copy-binary` / restage from
  `target/release/`) — otherwise the packaged backend can't exec and the app
  quits before the updater runs.
- New env knobs (all guarded, off by default): `BIOROUTER_UPDATE_FEED_URL`
  (generic feed for self-hosted/enterprise + testing), `BIOROUTER_UPDATE_AUTO_INSTALL=1`
  (test-only deterministic install, gated behind the feed override),
  `BIOROUTER_SKIP_NOTARIZE=1` (fast signed-but-not-notarized builds in `forge.config.ts`).

### Live Electron-runtime end-to-end run — one caveat to reproduce

`scripts/run-live-update-e2e.js` drives the **real** electron-updater engine in
a **real Electron 39.8.10 process** through the entire update pipeline and
passes (see the automated tests above). It proves the full happy path reaches the
`update-downloaded` state the one-click button depends on, and that a tampered
download is rejected by the real sha512 integrity check.

Reproduce caveat: this environment did not ship the Electron binary in
`node_modules/electron/dist` (only `LICENSES.chromium.html`; `path.txt` absent),
and the @electron/get re-download is network-blocked. It was made runnable by
populating the runtime from the on-disk @electron/get **cache**:

```bash
CACHE=~/Library/Caches/electron/<hash>/electron-v39.8.10-darwin-arm64.zip
rm -rf node_modules/electron/dist && mkdir -p node_modules/electron/dist
unzip -q "$CACHE" -d node_modules/electron/dist
printf 'Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron' > node_modules/electron/path.txt
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app   # clear Gatekeeper quarantine
# run Electron with ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE unset (this env sets it to 1):
env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE node scripts/run-live-update-e2e.js
```

On a normal dev machine `npm install` provides the Electron binary and the
runner works directly (it SKIPs gracefully if no Electron runtime is present).

The single step the live runner does **not** execute is the final
`quitAndInstall` OS swap: on macOS, Squirrel.Mac validates the downloaded app's
**code signature** before replacing the bundle, so it only completes for a
signed + notarized build — which is exactly Sections B/C below.

### Conditional sidebar UPDATE button — executed 2026-07-14

The updater checks shortly after every launch and then every three hours
while BioRouter stays open. Detection is non-interruptive: a small **UPDATE**
button appears above the BioRouter identity in the lower-left sidebar only when
a newer version is known. Clicking it opens the existing progress/restart
prompt; after BioRouter restarts on the current version, the button is absent.

- [x] `src/utils/updateCheckSchedule.test.ts` — **2** tests prove the startup
  delay, exact three-hour cadence, repeated checks, and cancellation.
- [x] `src/components/BioRouterSidebar/SidebarUpdateButton.test.tsx` — **5**
  tests cover hidden/current, visible/newer, persisted-state recovery,
  recheck/error stability, and button-to-modal integration.
- [x] Focused updater suite — **46/46** tests passed across cadence, reducer,
  sidebar, modal, and Settings update flows.
- [x] Full desktop suite — **104/104 files, 843/843 tests** passed.
- [x] Focused ESLint/Prettier, renderer/main/preload production builds,
  manifest compatibility, and the real Electron updater end-to-end run all passed.
- [x] Real Electron dev-app QA confirmed the button's lower-left placement,
  verified no modal appears on detection, clicked the button through the
  accessibility surface, and observed the normal update prompt open.

### Why Sections B and C still need a human and hardware

Everything that can be validated without minting an Apple-notarized binary and
installing it on a physical Mac has been validated above — including the real
electron-updater consumption of our manifest. The remainder (`scripts/release.sh
publish` of a signed/notarized release, then clicking **Restart & Update** on an
installed older build and watching the OS relaunch into the new version) requires
Apple Developer notarization credentials, ~10-minute platform builds, and a
Finder/Applications install — none of which exist in a CI/sandbox. Run them on a
release machine using the steps below.

## Pre-release checklist (Sections B–H)

Work through these for each release. The boxes below are intentionally
unticked — they are a template to fill in per release run, not a record of
past work. Cut a throwaway test release `X` that is **one patch newer** than an
installed build `X-1`, then proceed.

### Section B — release pipeline

Requires building a real signed and notarized release.

- [ ] `scripts/release.sh bump X` updates all 6 version-bearing files in lockstep (`scripts/check-version-consistency.sh` passes).
- [ ] `scripts/release.sh mac-arm64 X` and `mac-intel X` produce:
  - [ ] `ui/desktop/out/make/Biorouter-X-arm64.dmg` and `-x64.dmg`
  - [ ] `ui/desktop/out/make/zip/darwin/arm64/Biorouter-darwin-arm64-X.zip`
  - [ ] `ui/desktop/out/make/zip/darwin/x64/Biorouter-darwin-x64-X.zip`
- [ ] Each darwin zip contains `Biorouter.app/` at the **root** with a `Contents/_CodeSignature` (`unzip -l … | head`).
- [ ] The `.app` inside each zip is signed + **notarized**: `codesign -dv` and `xcrun stapler validate` pass on `out/Biorouter-darwin-<arch>/Biorouter.app`.
- [ ] `scripts/release.sh mac-manifest X` writes `out/make/latest-mac.yml`; it references **both** `Biorouter-darwin-arm64-X.zip` and `Biorouter-darwin-x64-X.zip` with correct sizes and base64 SHA-512.
- [ ] `scripts/release.sh verify X` reports all 10 file artifacts present + the `latest-mac.yml` arch-zip cross-check ✓, and verifies the local provenance manifest binds all 11 assets to the current source SHA.
- [ ] The draft contains **11** assets (5 GUI + 2 CLI + the headless Linux tarball + 2 darwin zips + `latest-mac.yml`). `scripts/release.sh publish X` must verify every uploaded SHA-256 digest against the local files before publication. Confirm with `gh release view vX --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'`.

### Section C — macOS GUI auto-update, the core flow (arm64 **and** Intel)

Install `X-1` into `/Applications`, launch it, then (with release `X` published):

- [ ] Within ~5s of launch, the lower-left **UPDATE** button appears without interrupting the user; clicking it opens **"Downloading update…"** with current vs new version and a live progress bar advancing 0→100%.
- [ ] During download the app stays fully usable (not blocked/frozen).
- [ ] When the download finishes, the modal switches to **"Update ready to install"** with a **Restart & Update** button.
- [ ] Clicking **Restart & Update**: the app quits, the new `.app` is installed in place, and BioRouter **relaunches automatically** on version `X` — no Finder, no DMG, no drag-and-drop, no manual quit.
- [ ] After relaunch, **About / Settings shows version `X`**.
- [ ] Repeat the entire flow on an **Intel** Mac (or Apple Silicon under Rosetta) and confirm it pulls the `x64` zip (check the app log: `electron-updater` logs the chosen file URL — it must contain `x64`, not `arm64`).
- [ ] Apple Silicon pulls the `arm64` zip (log file URL contains `arm64`).

### Section D — macOS "Later" dismissal and the Settings path

- [ ] Clicking **Later** dismisses the modal; because `autoInstallOnAppQuit = true`, quitting the app then installs the staged update — next launch is on `X`.
- [ ] Per-version dismissal: dismissing version `X` does not re-nag for `X` on the next launch (localStorage `biorouter:update-modal-dismissed-version`), but the **ready-to-install** state still surfaces.
- [ ] Settings → **Check for Updates**: when up to date shows "Biorouter is up to date."; when `X` is available it downloads with a progress bar and then shows a **Restart & Update to X** button that performs the same one-click install.
- [ ] Tray icon shows the update badge while an update is available; the tray "Update Available…" / "Check for Updates" items open Settings → update section.

### Section E — terminal and CLI propagation

- [ ] **macOS:** before update, `which biorouter` resolves to a symlink into `/Applications/Biorouter.app/Contents/Resources/bin/biorouter`. After the one-click update + relaunch, run `biorouter --version` in a **new** terminal → it reports `X` automatically (the symlink target was replaced in place). No second click needed.
- [ ] If the terminal `biorouter` was installed standalone (deb/rpm) or copied (Windows), the existing **"Biorouter CLI Update"** card appears post-update and its button re-links to the bundled `X` binary (`biorouter setup-path`). Confirm this card's behavior is **unchanged** from before.
- [ ] `biorouterd --version` (the daemon bundled in the app) reports `X` after update — the GUI spawns the bundled daemon, so it always matches the app.
- [ ] Launching the CLI from the GUI ("Open in terminal") starts the `X` CLI.

### Section F — settings, config and data preservation

All of this must survive the update. Before updating, note the contents of
`~/.config/biorouter/`. After the one-click update + relaunch, verify **nothing
is lost or reset**:

- [ ] `~/.config/biorouter/config.yaml` — providers, selected default provider/model, and **extensions** list unchanged.
- [ ] Secrets still resolve from the OS keychain (no re-entry of API keys; at most one Keychain prompt — "Always Allow").
- [ ] `~/.config/biorouter/sessions/` — prior chat sessions still listed and openable.
- [ ] `~/.config/biorouter/workflows/` and `skills/` intact.
- [ ] Knowledge bases under `~/.config/biorouter/knowledge/` intact, including the active-KB pointer `.active-kb`.
- [ ] Window state, theme, menu-bar/dock icon prefs preserved.
- [ ] Llama Server downloaded models (in the data dir) are not re-downloaded.

> **Why.** The update replaces only the **app bundle**; all user state
> lives under `~/.config/biorouter` (and the OS credential store), which the
> updater never touches. Confirm regardless.

### Section G — fallback and failure modes

- [ ] **Release without the manifest** (e.g. an older release, or pre-this-change): `electron-updater` 404s on `latest-mac.yml`; the app falls back to `githubUpdater` which auto-downloads the `.dmg` to `~/Downloads` and shows the guided "Open Folder & Quit" dialog. The modal still appears and never crashes. (`UpdaterState.usingFallback === true`.)
- [ ] **Offline at launch**: no modal, no error spam; app behaves normally. Reconnect → next check surfaces the update.
- [ ] **Download interrupted** (kill network mid-download): the modal shows an error state; restoring the network and re-checking (Settings) resumes/retries. A background error **after** a completed download does **not** hide the ready-to-install state.
- [ ] **Corrupt/altered zip** (tamper with one byte so SHA-512 mismatches the manifest): `electron-updater` rejects the update (signature/checksum failure) and does **not** install — surfaced as an error, app stays on `X-1`.
- [ ] **Same version** (`latest-mac.yml` version == installed): no update offered; Settings shows "up to date".
- [ ] **Downgrade** (publish an older version as latest): not offered (`allowDowngrade` is off by default).
- [ ] Modal can be opened/closed repeatedly without duplicate event listeners (the `onUpdaterEvent` disposer is called on unmount).

### Section H — regression on unchanged surfaces

- [ ] Dependency checker still runs ~4s after window ready and prompts for missing deps exactly as before.
- [ ] No change to onboarding, provider configuration, or any non-update UI.
- [ ] First-run (fresh install, no prior version) shows no spurious update modal.

### Sign-off

Tick these once per release run, after working through Sections B–H above.

- [ ] Section A (automated) fully green, pre-existing failure count unchanged.
- [ ] Sections C–F verified on **macOS arm64**.
- [ ] Sections C–F verified on **macOS Intel**.
- [ ] Section E CLI propagation verified.
- [ ] Section G fallback/failure modes verified.
- [ ] Windows/Linux assisted-download path spot-checked (see the platform support matrix).
