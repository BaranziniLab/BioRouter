## Overview

There is **no single "loop detector."** Loop/stuck defenses are spread across
five independent mechanisms, layered from cheap-and-local to
expensive-and-global:

1. **Exact-duplicate tool-call guard** — `RepetitionInspector` in
   `tool_monitor.rs`, run as one of the `ToolInspector`s before every tool
   batch. Denies the Nth consecutive byte-identical call (N > 3).
2. **Per-reply turn cap** — `DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS = 100` iterations of the main
   agent loop in `agent.rs`, a soft stop that asks the user to continue.
3. **Cooperative cancellation** — a `CancellationToken` polled at loop
   boundaries and threaded into MCP tool calls, tripped mainly by client
   disconnect (the "stop" button closing the SSE stream).
4. **Provider transient-error retry** — bounded exponential backoff in
   `providers/retry.rs` (3 attempts generic, 8 for HTTP 429).
5. **Goal-stall give-up** — only for explicit `/goal` sessions: fuzzy
   similarity of judge feedback across attempts (`goal.rs`).

Data flow of one reply (simplified):

```
reply(user_msg, session_config, cancel_token)               agent.rs:1240
  └─ reply_internal → async_stream loop                      agent.rs:1525
       loop {                                                 agent.rs:1556
         if is_token_cancelled(cancel_token) break            agent.rs:1557
         turns_taken += 1; if turns_taken > max_turns break   agent.rs:1571,1576
         drain_soft_interrupts()  (mid-turn user injects)     agent.rs:1589
         stream = provider.stream(...)                        agent.rs:1603
         while chunk in stream {                              agent.rs:1628
            if is_token_cancelled break                       agent.rs:1629
            on tool_requests:
              inspection = tool_inspection_manager
                              .inspect_tools(...)              agent.rs:1723
                └─ RepetitionInspector::inspect → Deny(REP-001) tool_monitor.rs:107
              apply_inspection_results_to_permissions → denied tool_inspection.rs:181
              dispatch approved tools (cancel_token passed)    agent.rs:836/1757
                └─ mcp await_response select! on cancel        mcp_client.rs:357
         }
         if no_tools_called:
            finish_reason=="length"? auto-continue (≤12)       agent.rs:2053
            else final_output / retry_logic / stop-hook        agent.rs:2072-2232
       }
```

Provider retries (`providers/retry.rs`) sit *inside* `provider.stream(...)`;
the workflow `RetryManager` (`agents/retry.rs`) sits at the very end, resetting
history and re-running when `retry_config` success-checks fail.

## Answers

### How does the system deal with infinite loops / repetitive identical tool calls?

The only general-purpose repetition guard is `RepetitionInspector`
(`tool_monitor.rs`). It is registered as a `ToolInspector` at
`agent.rs:355-357` with threshold `DEFAULT_MAX_REPETITIONS = 3`
(`agent.rs:70`).

**What it tracks / how "identical" is defined.** A call is reduced to
`InternalToolCall { name, parameters }` and two calls match on **exact tool
name plus byte-exact JSON argument equality**:

```rust
// tool_monitor.rs:18-20
fn matches(&self, other: &InternalToolCall) -> bool {
    self.name == other.name && self.parameters == other.parameters
}
```

**Two divergent implementations live in this one struct**, and this matters:

- `check_tool_call` (`tool_monitor.rs:59-88`) is the imperative, stateful
  version that mutates `last_call` / `repeat_count` and returns `false` when
  `repeat_count > max_repetitions`. **It is only invoked from tests**
  (`crates/biorouter/tests/repetition_inspector_tests.rs:25-47`). The
  production loop never calls it.
- `inspect` (`tool_monitor.rs:107-164`) is the `ToolInspector` trait method
  that production actually runs (via `inspect_tools`, `agent.rs:1723`). Because
  it takes `&self`, it cannot mutate the struct; instead it **re-derives the
  streak from scratch every batch** by walking the full `messages` history and
  then the new `tool_requests` (`tool_monitor.rs:119-161`), counting only
  **consecutive** identical calls and resetting to 1 on any different call
  (`tool_monitor.rs:128-143`).

**Threshold / trigger.** The comparison is strict `>` (`tool_monitor.rs:145`),
so three consecutive identical calls are allowed and the **fourth** is denied.
On trigger it emits:

```rust
// tool_monitor.rs:151-159
InspectionResult {
    action: InspectionAction::Deny,
    reason: format!("Tool '{}' has exceeded maximum repetitions", tool_name),
    confidence: 1.0,
    inspector_name: "repetition",
    finding_id: Some("REP-001"),
}
```

**What happens on trigger.** `apply_inspection_results_to_permissions`
(`tool_inspection.rs:181-261`) moves the request out of `approved` /
`needs_approval` into `denied` (`tool_inspection.rs:217-236`). Denied tools are
then handled by `handle_denied_tools` (`agent.rs:748-781`), which writes a
synthetic tool response with `is_error: true` and the text `DECLINED_RESPONSE`:

> "The user has declined to run this tool. DO NOT attempt to call this tool
> again. If there are no alternative methods to proceed, clearly explain the
> situation and STOP." (`agents/tool_execution.rs:38-40`)

Critically, the repetition-specific reason is **swallowed**: only *hook*
denials get their reason appended to the model-visible text
(`agent.rs:757-766`). So when the repetition inspector fires, the model is told
"the user declined" — which is false, and gives the model no signal that it was
looping. The tool simply does not execute; the turn continues.

### Is there a max-turns / max-tool-calls cap per reply?

Yes for turns, **no dedicated cap for tool calls**.

`DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS = 100` (`agent.rs:69`). Per reply it is resolved as
`session_config.max_turns` → env `BIOROUTER_MAX_TURNS` → default
(`agent.rs:1547-1550`). `SessionConfig.max_turns` is `Option<u32>`
(`agents/types.rs:91`); the interactive `/reply` route hard-codes
`max_turns: None` (`reply.rs:297`), so ordinary chat always uses 100.

`turns_taken` increments once per loop iteration (`agent.rs:1571`). At
`turns_taken > max_turns` the loop yields a **soft** message and breaks:

```rust
// agent.rs:1576-1583
if turns_taken > max_turns {
    yield AgentEvent::Message(Message::assistant().with_text(format!(
        "I've reached my action limit for this turn ({max_turns} actions without
         user input), so I'm stopping here ... Would you like me to continue?
         (raise the cap with `max_turns` / `BIOROUTER_MAX_TURNS`.)")));
    break;
}
```

It is a graceful stop that invites continuation, not a hard error.

**No max-tool-calls cap.** The cap counts loop *iterations* (provider
round-trips). A single iteration can request and run many tools in parallel
(the combined `stream::select_all`, `agent.rs:1792-1843`), so "100 actions" is
a loose bound on real work and cost. The `call_counts` HashMap in
`RepetitionInspector` (`tool_monitor.rs:46`) tracks per-tool totals but is
**never read for any decision** — there is no "this tool has run 200 times"
guard.

Adjacent bounds that also cap loop-like behavior:
- `MAX_TRUNCATION_CONTINUATIONS = 12` (`agent.rs:76`) — auto-continues of a
  `finish_reason=="length"` truncated response, reset to 0 whenever a tool runs
  (`agent.rs:2053-2118`).
- `compaction_attempts >= 2` (`agent.rs:1967`) — context-overflow compaction
  retries before giving up.
- `STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP = 5` (`hooks/mod.rs:44`) — how many times a Stop hook can
  block completion before finishing anyway (`agent.rs:2160-2178`).
- Goal system: `GOAL_MAX_ITERATIONS = 20`, `GOAL_STALL_LIMIT = 3`
  (`goal.rs:53-55`).

### How does cancellation work mid-turn?

Cancellation is **cooperative**, via `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`
threaded from `reply` → `reply_internal` (`agent.rs:1244,1525`) and into tool
dispatch.

**How it is tripped.** For interactive chat the dominant trigger is *client
disconnect*. `stream_event` in `reply.rs` cancels when the SSE `tx.send` fails,
i.e. the browser closed the stream (the stop button aborts the fetch):

```rust
// reply.rs:195-198
if tx.send(format!("data: {}\n\n", json)).await.is_err() {
    tracing::info!("client hung up");
    cancel_token.cancel();
}
```

The server task also selects on `task_cancel.cancelled()` (`reply.rs:347-350`)
and drops the reply stream when it breaks. The Agent Drafter WebSocket path adds
an explicit `{"type":"cancel"}` frame that calls `cancel.cancel()`
(`routes/apps.rs:856`) plus `ui_bridge.cancel_all()`.

**Where it is observed.** `is_token_cancelled` (`utils.rs:44-48`) is polled at
three loop boundaries: the top of the main loop (`agent.rs:1557`), before each
provider stream chunk (`agent.rs:1629`), and while draining the combined tool
result stream (`agent.rs:1798-1800`).

**In-flight tool calls.** The token is passed into `dispatch_tool_call`
(`agent.rs:836-960`) and reaches the MCP client's `await_response`, which
`select!`s the response against a timeout and the token, and on cancel sends an
MCP `cancel` notification to the server before returning `Cancelled`:

```rust
// mcp_client.rs:365-376
tokio::select! {
    result = receiver => { ... }
    _ = tokio::time::sleep(timeout) => { send_cancel_message(...,"timed out"); Err(Timeout) }
    _ = cancel_token.cancelled() => { send_cancel_message(...,"operation cancelled"); Err(Cancelled) }
}
```

So a remote MCP tool is told to abort. The turn's usage is still recorded once
on stream end "whether the stream finished, was cancelled, or errored"
(`agent.rs:2032-2037`).

**Gap:** cancellation is checked *between* awaited items, never inside a
blocking tool body. A built-in tool that ignores the token (e.g. a synchronous
computation) keeps running until it returns; the loop only notices at the next
boundary. There is no forced tokio task abort — dropping the stream relies on
`Drop`/`kill_on_drop` for subprocesses to actually stop work. Also note the
soft-interrupt path (`/interrupt` → `queue_soft_interrupt` →
`drain_soft_interrupts`, `reply.rs:494-505`, `agent.rs:1589-1594`) is a
deliberate *non-cancelling* alternative that injects a user message at a safe
boundary.

### Is there anything that detects a local minimum (same failing approach repeatedly) beyond exact-duplicate detection?

Mostly **no**, and this is the biggest honest gap.

`RepetitionInspector` catches only **exact consecutive duplicates** (identical
name + byte-identical JSON). It is trivially defeated by:
- changing any argument by one character (a different retry of the same failing
  command counts as "new"),
- oscillation `A, B, A, B, ...` (the streak resets on every switch,
  `tool_monitor.rs:130-133`),
- semantically identical but textually different calls.

It also does **not** look at tool *results* at all — repeated identical error
messages, "no such file" over and over, or a command that keeps failing the same
way are invisible to it. There is no no-progress detector (e.g. "no file changed
/ no new information in N turns"), no embedding/semantic similarity, and no
result-hash tracking.

The **one** place with fuzzier stall detection is the goal system
(`goal.rs`), and it only applies to explicit `/goal` sessions. When a goal is
active, each Stop-hook block increments `iterations`, and consecutive judge
feedback strings are compared with `reason_similarity` (Jaccard overlap of word
sets, `goal.rs:121-133`); `stall_count` increments when similarity ≥
`GOAL_STALL_SIMILARITY = 0.5` and the goal gives up when
`stall_count >= GOAL_STALL_LIMIT (3)` or `iterations >= GOAL_MAX_ITERATIONS
(20)` (`goal.rs:301-320`). That is genuine progress-stall detection — but for
ordinary chat it is absent. For a normal conversation the only guardrails
against a stuck loop are: (a) the exact-duplicate inspector, and (b) the 100-turn
hard cap.

### How do provider retry loops interact (could retries themselves loop)?

Provider retries are **self-bounded and cannot loop infinitely on their own.**
`providers/retry.rs` retries only transient errors
(`RateLimitExceeded | ServerError | RequestFailed`, `should_retry`
`retry.rs:117-124`) with exponential backoff + jitter, capped at
`DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 3` (`retry.rs:34`), or `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_RETRIES = 8`
for HTTP 429 (`retry.rs:44-54`). Both `retry_operation` (`retry.rs:126-173`)
and `ProviderRetry::with_retry` (`retry.rs:182-233`) terminate after the budget
and return `Err`.

Three distinct "retry" layers exist and do **not** feed each other into a loop:
1. Provider transient retry (`providers/retry.rs`) — inside a single
   `provider.stream(...)`.
2. Agent loop error handling — on a non-retryable/exhausted provider error the
   loop yields "Ran into this error… Please retry if you think this is
   transient" and **breaks** (`agent.rs:2020-2027`); on `ContextLengthExceeded`
   it compacts, bounded by `compaction_attempts >= 2` (`agent.rs:1964-2018`).
   Neither re-enters provider retry automatically, so no tight loop forms.
3. Workflow `RetryManager` (`agents/retry.rs`) — after a turn ends, if
   `retry_config` success-checks fail and `attempts < max_retries`
   (`retry.rs:130-155`), it resets the whole conversation to `initial_messages`
   and re-runs. Bounded by `max_retries`.

**Compounding risk, not infinite loop.** Retries *multiply*: each of up to 100
agent turns can itself do up to 3 (or 8) provider retries, and 429 backoff can
be ~8 × up to 30 s ≈ 2 minutes *per provider call* inside a turn. There is **no
global wall-clock or token budget per reply** — only the iteration count — so a
throttled session can legitimately run a very long time without tripping any
loop guard. BioRouter does surface rate-limit state to the scheduler via
`RATE_LIMITED_UNTIL_MS` (`retry.rs:14-32`) so *background* jobs back off, which
is a nice touch, but it does not bound the interactive reply.

**Dead-code caveat.** `RetryManager` can hold a `repetition_inspector` and
`reset_attempts` would reset it (`agents/retry.rs:63-83`), but
`with_repetition_inspector` is **never called** — the agent constructs
`RetryManager::new()` (`agent.rs:258`). So that reset is a permanent no-op, and
the `RepetitionInspector` instance registered in the inspection manager is a
*different* object whose imperative state is never touched in production anyway.

## Notable design choices (worth keeping)

- **Soft turn cap that asks the user** rather than hard-failing, and is
  user-raisable via `max_turns` / `BIOROUTER_MAX_TURNS` (`agent.rs:1576-1583`).
- **Cancellation that notifies the remote tool** — the MCP `cancel`
  notification (`mcp_client.rs:373-375`) lets servers abort real work, not just
  detach a future.
- **Soft interrupt as a first-class alternative to cancel** — injecting a
  mid-turn user message at a safe boundary avoids discarding in-flight work and
  a full context re-send (`reply.rs:494-505`, `agent.rs:1589-1594`).
- **Deeper, separate retry budget for 429s** plus scheduler-visible rate-limit
  state so background load stops piling onto a throttled key
  (`retry.rs:44-54,14-32`).
- **Truncation continuation with its own streak cap that resets on real
  progress** (`agent.rs:2053-2118`) — distinguishes "cut off by length limit"
  from "chose to stop."
- **Goal give-up-on-stall** — fuzzy feedback similarity plus an iteration cap is
  a genuinely good local-minimum pattern (`goal.rs:301-320`); it just needs to
  reach general chat.
- Inspectors are pluggable and fail-open per inspector (a crashing inspector is
  logged and skipped, `tool_inspection.rs:108-116`) — robust, though see the gap
  about swallowed reasons.

## Gaps & weaknesses (feeds the improvement phase)

1. **Exact-duplicate only — trivially defeated.** `matches` requires byte-exact
   JSON (`tool_monitor.rs:18-20`) and only counts *consecutive* calls. A
   one-character arg change, an `A/B/A/B` oscillation, or the same failing
   command with a tweaked flag all bypass it. State-of-the-art coding agents
   detect repeated *failing outcomes* and no-progress loops; BioRouter does not.

2. **The block reason is hidden from the model.** On a repetition denial the
   model receives generic `DECLINED_RESPONSE` ("the user has declined…"), not
   the true "exceeded maximum repetitions" (`agent.rs:757-766` only forwards
   *hook* reasons). This is actively misleading: the model may abandon a tool it
   legitimately needs, or hallucinate that the user refused. The REP-001 reason
   should be surfaced with guidance to change approach.

3. **Two implementations, tested path ≠ production path.** `check_tool_call`
   (stateful) is what the unit tests exercise
   (`tests/repetition_inspector_tests.rs`), but production runs `inspect`
   (stateless). The struct's `last_call` / `repeat_count` / `call_counts` /
   `reset()` are effectively dead in production. High risk that a future fix or
   tuning lands in the untested-in-prod path. Consolidate to one implementation.

4. **`inspect` recomputes over full history every batch** (`tool_monitor.rs:
   119-134`) — O(messages) per tool batch, quadratic across a long session.
   Minor now, but it also means the "3 strikes" window is *global consecutive*
   and silently resets whenever any different call is interleaved, weakening it
   further.

5. **`call_counts` is tracked but never used.** No absolute per-tool ceiling
   (`tool_monitor.rs:46,61-65`). A tool called hundreds of times with
   ever-changing args never trips anything except the 100-turn cap.

6. **No global time or token budget per reply.** Only iteration count bounds a
   turn; provider 429 backoff (~2 min/call) compounds inside it. A pathological
   or throttled session can run far longer than a user expects with no
   wall-clock guard.

7. **Cancellation is cooperative and boundary-only.** A tool that ignores the
   token blocks cancel until it returns; there is no hard task abort, and cancel
   checks never occur inside a tool body (`agent.rs:1557,1629,1798`). Long
   synchronous built-in tools are effectively uncancellable mid-execution.

8. **`max_turns` counts loop iterations, not tool calls.** With parallel tool
   fan-out per iteration, the 100 "actions" bound is loose relative to real
   cost/side-effects.

9. **Local-minimum detection is gated behind `/goal`.** The good stall logic in
   `goal.rs` never runs for ordinary chat, which is where most stuck loops
   actually happen.

10. **Latent dead-code coupling.** The workflow `RetryManager`'s
    repetition-inspector reset is never wired (`agent.rs:258` uses
    `RetryManager::new()`), so anyone reasoning about "history reset also resets
    repetition state" is wrong — a subtle trap.

**Net assessment.** The subsystem is defensive enough to prevent a truly
unbounded hang (the 100-turn cap and self-bounded provider retries guarantee
termination), but its *loop-quality* detection is well behind modern coding
agents: it catches only literal identical-call spam, hides the reason from the
model, tests a code path production never runs, and has no notion of "same
failing approach" or "no progress" outside the opt-in goal system.
