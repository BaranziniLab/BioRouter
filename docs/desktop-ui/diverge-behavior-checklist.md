# Diverge behavior checklist

> **What this is.** A catalog of 68 concrete user actions for **Diverge** — the feature
> that branches a conversation into a new session — paired with the behavior BioRouter
> must exhibit for each. It doubles as a manual QA script and as the spec the automated
> tests encode.
> **Status:** Current. Last revised 2026-07-18, when the ~25 dashboard-canvas items were
> deleted alongside dashboard mode itself.
> **Audience:** maintainers of the desktop chat UI, and anyone running a Diverge
> regression pass.

Three labelling schemes are used below, and every one of them is cited elsewhere in the
repo, so keep the identifiers stable when editing:

- **Items 1–68** run in one continuous sequence across the lettered sections. Use the
  section index to find which section an item number lives in.
- **Sections A–I** group the items by surface or concern.
- **Invariants I1–I4** are the four core guarantees stated below; the rest of the
  document is a consequence of them, and section I checks I2 directly.

Each item is tagged with how it is verified: **[T]** is covered by an automated test
(see the coverage map at the end); **[UI]** requires driving the real app.

Two window-model terms appear throughout. **Hub** is the landing screen where a user
starts a new conversation (`ui/desktop/src/components/Hub.tsx`). **Pair** is the tabbed
chat route at `/pair` that a conversation opens into.

> **Note.** 2026-07-18 — dashboard mode removed. This checklist previously carried ~25
> items about diverging on the free-floating dashboard canvas, including a whole section
> on "Chat ⇄ Dashboard isolation". Dashboard mode has been removed in favour of tabs,
> chat groups and split panes, so diverge no longer branches on canvas-vs-chat — it
> *always* opens a new Electron window. Those items were vacuous and have been deleted;
> everything below still describes real behaviour. See the
> [dashboard mode history](../history/dashboard-mode/README.md) for what was removed.
> Release notes and the dated dashboard plans and specs are historical records and were
> left untouched.

## Core invariants

- **I1.** Diverge branches the conversation into a *new session* that inherits the full
  history; the **original session is never mutated**.
- **I2.** Diverge only ever *spins up a new chat surface*. It changes nothing else about
  the agent, the current window, or other conversations.
- **I3.** Diverge **always opens a new, focused Electron window**. There is a single
  diverge surface — it never navigates the current window and never re-uses a tab or
  split pane.
- **I4.** Closing a chat surface **never deletes a conversation.** A branch, once
  created, stays in History until the user deletes it explicitly.

## Section index

| Section | Topic | Items |
|---------|-------|-------|
| A | Button presence and affordance | 1–8 |
| B | Diverge in a chat window | 9–20 |
| C | Diverge via the `/diverge` slash command (GUI) | 21–27 |

| G | Edge cases and failure modes | 47–56 |
| H | Persistence and reload | 57–58 |
| I | "Changes nothing else" guarantees (I2) | 59–68 |

## A. Button presence and affordance

1. **[UI]** Finish an assistant reply in a chat → a **Diverge** action appears next to **Copy** on hover.
2. **[UI]** While the assistant is still streaming → Diverge is **not** shown.
3. **[UI]** On a message containing a tool call/result → Diverge is **not** shown (text-only messages only).
4. **[UI]** On a user message → no Diverge (only assistant messages).
5. **[T]** Button is disabled while a diverge is in flight (no double-trigger).
6. **[UI]** Hover tooltip reads "Branch this conversation into a new window (keeps full history)" — one wording, on every chat surface.
7. **[UI]** Diverge button has an accessible label ("Diverge conversation into a new chat").
8. **[T]** Rapid triple-click triggers exactly **one** diverge.

## B. Diverge in a chat window (Hub / Pair / tab / split pane)

9. **[UI]** Diverge from a Pair window → a **second** Electron window opens.
10. **[UI]** The new window is **focused / in front**; the original stays where it was.
11. **[UI]** The new window is **offset** (~40px) from the original so both are visible.
12. **[UI]** The new window shows the **full prior history** of the original.
13. **[UI]** The original window is **unchanged** — same session id, same scroll, still interactive.
14. **[T]** The code path calls `window.electron.createDivergedChatWindow(workingDir, newSessionId)` — a new window, never an in-place navigation.
15. **[UI]** Continue typing in the new window → it appends to the **branch**, not the original.
16. **[UI]** Continue typing in the original window → unaffected by the branch.
17. **[UI]** Diverge twice from the same message → two independent new windows/sessions.
18. **[UI]** Close the new branch window → the original window and session remain intact.
19. **[UI]** Diverge from the Hub landing chat behaves the same as from Pair.
20. **[UI]** Model / mode / extensions in the new window match the branch's inherited config; the original's are untouched.

## C. Diverge via the `/diverge` slash command (GUI)

21. **[UI]** Type `/diverge` in the chat input → it appears in the slash popover.
22. **[UI]** Select it (Enter) → inserts `/diverge`; Enter again → branches (does **not** send a chat message).
23. **[UI]** `/diverge` from a chat opens a new focused window (same as the button).
24. **[UI]** `/diverge` with leading/trailing spaces still triggers.
25. **[UI]** `/divergexyz` or `/diverge now` is treated as a normal message (no branch).
26. **[UI]** `/diverge` with no active session yet (empty Hub) is a no-op, input clears.
27. **[UI]** After `/diverge`, the input is cleared and the original conversation is unchanged.

## D. Diverge via `/diverge` in the CLI and TUI

28. **[T]** CLI parser maps `/diverge` → `InputResult::Diverge`; near-misses don't.
29. **[T]** `/diverge` is in the CLI completion registry.
30. **[T]** The deeplink is `biorouter://diverge?session_id=…&dir=…`, URL-encoded.
31. **[UI]** Running `/diverge` in the TUI prints "Diverged into a new window (session …)".
32. **[UI]** The TUI's own conversation is unchanged after `/diverge`.
33. **[UI]** The deeplink opens a **new, focused** desktop window with the branch (`main.ts` `diverge` handler).
34. **[UI]** If the desktop app can't be opened, the TUI still reports the created branch + the link.
35. **[T]** A branch session row is created in the DB with full history + lineage.
36. **[UI]** Classic CLI `/diverge` renders the success/"couldn't open" output.

## E. Closing surfaces and data preservation

37. **[UI]** Closing a branch window **never** deletes its session — it is still listed in History.
38. **[UI]** Closing the *original* window never affects the branch, and vice-versa.
39. **[UI]** Close a branch window, then reopen it from History → it still loads with the full inherited history.

## F. Naming and lineage

40. **[T]** Branch name = `"{parent} (branch 1)"`, `"(branch 2)"`, … (sibling-numbered).
41. **[T]** Diverging a branch flattens numbering (no `(branch 1) (branch 1)`).
42. **[T]** Placeholder parent name → branch name derived from the conversation.
43. **[T]** Branch records `diverged_from = parent id`.
44. **[T]** Branch token counts reset; the parent's are preserved.
45. **[UI]** History shows "⑂ branched from {parent}" on a branch; parent shows none.
46. **[T]** A custom name passed to diverge overrides the auto branch name.

## G. Edge cases and failure modes

47. **[T]** Diverge with no session id → error toast, nothing opens.
48. **[T]** Backend diverge fails → error toast, nothing opens, original intact.
49. **[T]** Diverge response missing session id → error toast, nothing opens.
50. **[T]** Nonexistent source session → backend 404.
51. **[T]** Invalid session id → backend 400.
52. **[T]** Name longer than 200 chars → backend 400.
53. **[UI]** Diverge an empty conversation → branch created (empty), original intact.
54. **[T]** Concurrent diverges from one session → unique branch ids, no collision.
55. **[UI]** Diverge while the agent is mid-stream is not offered (button hidden while streaming).
56. **[T]** LIKE-wildcard names (`100%_done`) don't break sibling counting.

## H. Persistence and reload

57. **[UI]** A branch window survives an app restart (the session is in History).
58. **[UI]** Reload the app with a branch window open → it re-loads its session with full history.

## I. "Changes nothing else" guarantees (I2)

59. **[UI]** Diverge does not change the current window's model, mode, or extensions.
60. **[UI]** Diverge does not interrupt a different conversation's in-flight stream.
61. **[UI]** Diverge does not alter scroll position or input contents of other surfaces.
62. **[UI]** Switching conversations in chat after a diverge behaves exactly as before.
63. **[UI]** Opening/closing/reordering other tabs and split panes is unaffected by a diverge.
64. **[UI]** Knowledge / workflow / scheduler views are unaffected by diverge.
65. **[UI]** Diverge works regardless of the active provider/model.
66. **[UI]** Diverge from a renamed session keeps the original's user-set name.
67. **[UI]** The original conversation can still be exported/diverged/edited after a diverge.
68. **[UI]** No extra biorouterd backends leak per diverge beyond the new window's own.
