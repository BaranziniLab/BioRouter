 * test would keep resolving to the half that tinted first, and the zone would
 * latch there: you could never aim at the other half, and you could never leave

/**
 * The tab, lifted under the cursor: fixed, 2deg, popover shadow (spec card ∇).
 *
 * Also pointer-events:none, and for a sharper reason than the overlay — the
 * ghost sits directly UNDER the cursor by construction, so if it took events it
 * would shadow every group equally and elementFromPoint would return the ghost
 * on every single move. The drop target would be null for the entire drag and
 * nothing would ever land.
 *
 * The ghost is a SEPARATE element; the source tab stays in flow at 35%
 * (.br-tab[data-dragging]). main.css's drag block explains why that matters:
 * .br-tab's divider is adjacent-sibling based, so pulling the real tab out of
 * the DOM would re-flow every divider in the strip mid-drag.
 *
 * `detached` marks the moment the drag left the window and the drop would make a
 * new one (tear-off design D7): the tilt returns to 0 and it takes the dashed
 * accent outline the drop zones already use, because a flat, outlined rectangle
 * detached from the strip reads as a window and a tilted one riding the strip
 * reads as a tab.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THERE ARE NOW TWO GHOSTS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS EVER ON SCREEN.
 *
 * A renderer paints only into its own `BrowserWindow`, so this `<div>` cannot
 * follow the cursor onto the desktop — the clamp below is what that impossibility
 * costs. Phase 4b (issue #75) added the other kind: main opens a real
 * transparent, click-through, always-on-top window and flies THAT under the
 * cursor (`dragGhostWindow.ts`). When it is up it sends `tab-drag:ghost-window`
 * `{active: true}` and this one goes `visibility: hidden` — two tabs in the air
 * at once, one pinned at the window edge and one on the desktop, would read as a
 * duplication bug.
 *
 * IT HIDES RATHER THAN UNMOUNTING, on purpose. The element stays measured and in
 * the tree, so coming back inside the window (which destroys the OS ghost and
 * clears the flag) restores it in the same frame instead of paying a remount, and
 * main can still read it. THE CLAMP AND ITS TESTS STAY for exactly the same
 * reason: the OS ghost is best-effort — the probe can fail, the window can fail
 * to load, and there is no OS ghost at all until the first `detach` reaches main
 * — and in every one of those cases this element is what the user sees.
 *
 * MAIN READS THIS ELEMENT'S DOM. `dragGhostWindow.ts`'s `GHOST_PROBE_SCRIPT`
 * selects `.br-tab-ghost` and reads `data-grab-x`/`data-grab-y`, the measured
 * box and the resolved theme colours out of it, because `tab-drag:move` carries
 * only `{screenX, screenY}` and nothing else on the wire can describe the tab.
 * Renaming the class or dropping those attributes silently downgrades the OS
 * ghost to its defaults — a generic untitled chip.
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * THE CLAMP IS HERE, THE PAINT RULE IS NOT. Obligation 4 of Phase 3 is the
 * clamp: a detached ghost is held inside this window's content rect, because an
 * unclamped ghost is simply clipped at the edge — which reads as the tab having
 * been eaten rather than as one about to become a window. It is done HERE and
 * not in the hook because it needs the ghost's RENDERED SIZE, which only the
 * element that renders it can measure (a tab is 88–190px wide depending on its
 * title, so a constant would clamp a long one short and let a short one hang
 * off).
