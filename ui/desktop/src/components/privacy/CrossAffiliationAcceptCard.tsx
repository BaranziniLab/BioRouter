 * The user's accept control for one stated cross-institutional data flow
 * (issue #56, DR-26 / Task 57).
 *
 * ⚠ **It renders where the refusal lands** — inside the failed tool call in the
 * transcript, immediately under the daemon's own words. That placement is the
 * whole fix: the mechanism has existed since Task 49, and what was missing was
 * an affordance on the surface where the person meets the refusal. A control
 * somewhere else (a settings screen, a separate dialog they must go find) is the
 * same hard block with an extra step.
 *
 * ⚠ **The agent cannot press it.** DR-19: the model may ask, only the user may
 * answer. Two things hold that, and neither is this component's good intentions
 * — the daemon requires `X-User-Action`, which no tool-call path can carry; and
 * exactly one renderer module may name the grant call, audited by
 * `utils/crossAffiliation.test.ts`. The third thing this comment used to claim —
 * that the call has exactly one caller, and that it is an `onClick` — is true
 * today but is **not** what that audit pins; see the note on
 * {@link acceptCrossAffiliationFlow}'s module.
 *
 * ⚠ **What is deliberately NOT here: the risk statement.** The refusal directly
 * above this card already carries the warning verbatim, naming both
 * institutions, composed once in `privacy::affiliation` so every surface states
 * it in the same words. Restating it here would be a second account of one
 * boundary. What this adds is the half the refusal cannot state — how far a yes
 * reaches — and that comes from {@link GRANT_SCOPE_COPY}, mirrored from the
 * daemon rather than written again.
 *
 * ⚠ **DR-27's three modes are a difference in what the press COSTS, never in
 * whether there is one** (issue #56, DR-27). `standard` and `strict` render
 * the same control, post the same body to the same route, and differ in one
 * sentence of copy — because the extra proof `strict` demands is raised by the
 * DAEMON, not here: `agent_cross_affiliation_grant` calls
 * `strict_mode_authorization`, which reads `privacy::mixing::policy()` itself
 * and puts the operating system's dialog between the resolution and the write.
 * A renderer that branched further would be a second reader of the policy, and
 * the two would eventually disagree about a control the user has just used.
 *
 * ⚠ **Do not restore the dead end this used to have.** Between Task 57 and Task
 * 52 the strict branch rendered "this build cannot ask for a system password, so
 * the flow cannot be approved" — correct when it was written, and left standing
 * after DR-24's prompters and the daemon's strict layer landed. What it left
 * behind was a mode in which a cross-institutional flow could not be accepted at
 * all: the hard block DR-26 exists to prevent, restored for exactly the
 * deployments careful enough to choose `strict`. If a future build genuinely
 * cannot prompt, the honest refusal is the daemon's — `strict_mode_authorization`
 * answers 403 for an `Unavailable` prompter, naming the platform — and it
 * arrives through {@link approve}'s error path, after a press, rather than as a
 * renderer's guess before one.
