/**
 * The served long-form disclosure, rendered (issue #56, DR-17 requirement 3).
 *
 * ⚠ **One renderer, because there is one copy.** The dialog and Settings →
 * Privacy both show `COPY_LONG`, and a second implementation of "split the
 * paragraphs, honour the emphasis" is how one surface ends up printing `**` at
 * the user while the other does not. This component contains no product prose of
 * its own — every word comes from `disclosureCopy.ts`, which got it from
 * `crates/biorouter/src/privacy/disclosure.rs` over the wire.
 *
 * ⚠ **The emphasis is load-bearing, not decoration.** `**…**` marks the two
 * clauses that say what is *not* protected. Ordering alone does not carry the
 * ruling: three paragraphs of identical weight let a skimmer take the middle one
 * — the flattering half, the three things Biorouter does stop — as the summary
 * and conclude the machine is opaque to a public model, which is the reading
 * DR-17 forbids. Stripping the markers would be as wrong as printing them.
