   * ⚠ The reason `asChild` exists, and it is an accessibility fix rather than a
   * convenience.
   *
   * The global focus rule (design system D-15) paints
   * `background-color: var(--background-focus)` on the focused `<button>`, and
   * `tone="neutral"` is `bg-background-medium` — an OPAQUE fill. A
   * `<button><Badge/></button>` therefore covers its own focus surface
   * completely, and a keyboard user gets no focus indication at all on any
   * toggle chip. With `asChild` the fill and the focus surface are the same box.
   *
   * jsdom cannot see the paint, so what is asserted is the structure that makes
   * it possible: ONE element, which is the caller's button, wearing the badge's
   * classes.
