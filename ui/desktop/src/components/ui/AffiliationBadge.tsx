/**
 * The affiliation indicator (issue #56, DR-26) — the second of the two privacy
 * axes, rendered beside the first.
 *
 * ⚠ **It is deliberately the same SHAPE as `PrivacyBadge`**: the same `Badge`
 * primitive, so the same radius/padding/type scale; the same
 * `bg-background-muted` fill, which is contrast for the ink rather than the
 * signal; a glyph plus a word rather than a colour. The two axes are different
 * questions about one chat, and a user has to read them as one system — an
 * affiliation chip in a different visual language would read as a third,
 * unrelated status.
 *
 * ⚠ **What it never does is imply an ORDER between the three affiliations.**
 * There is no ranking: `local` is the most permissive (it reaches everything
 * private, because nothing leaves the machine), `unstated` the least (it reaches
 * only extensions claiming no institution), and an institution sits between them
 * *for that institution's data only*. No tone, weight or colour is varied across
 * the three, because any variation would be read as a scale, and the scale
 * people would infer — "more specific means more restricted" — is backwards.
 *
 * ⚠ **Never a control.** Nothing here is sent back to the daemon: the grant
 * route reads the institution from its own sample, and a client-supplied one
 * would let a caller record an acceptance for a triple the user was never shown
 * (`utils/crossAffiliation.ts`). This component renders and does nothing else.
