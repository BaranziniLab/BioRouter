/**
 * The one small-label primitive, in the two tiers §3.4 makes explicit.
 *
 * The distinction is not decorative and it is enforced by the type, because the
 * app previously had four hand-rolled recipes and no way to say which was which:
 *
 * - **badge** (default) — 20px. Carries STATUS: what a thing currently is.
 * - **chip** — 24px. Carries a CATEGORY or a filter: what a thing is filed under.
 *
 * A chip is the larger of the two because it is the one you may eventually be
 * able to act on (§3.4 allows it a 16px remove control); a badge is a read-only
 * fact and gets out of the way. Both are squared at `--radius-inner`: A-04
 * restricts `--radius-full` to status dots, the switch knob and avatars, so the
 * two tiers are separated by height and role rather than by corner — which also
 * means neither can quietly become the other by losing a class.
 *
 * Tone is one formula, not six hand-picked pairs: the hue at 22% behind that same
 * hue's saturated ink (§2.5). `neutral` is the exception on purpose — it has no
 * hue to wash, so it takes a real surface step instead.

   * Render the chip's own child element instead of a `<span>` — so a TOGGLE
   * chip IS the button rather than a `<span>` wrapped in one.
   *
   * ⚠ This is not a convenience. The global focus rule (design system D-15)
   * paints `background-color: var(--background-focus)` on the focused
   * `<button>`, and `tone="neutral"` is `bg-background-medium` — an OPAQUE fill.
   * A `<button><Badge/></button>` therefore covers its own focus surface
   * completely and a keyboard user gets no focus indication at all. With
   * `asChild` the fill and the focus surface are the same box, so the focus
   * treatment reads. It also keeps toggle chips out of the raw-`<button>`
   * backlog (DR-24). P4: if a surface needs a variant, the variant lives in the
   * primitive.
   *
   * The pressed state is `tint-selected tint-interactive`, never
   * `tone="accent"`: the tints are translucent and the focus fill reads through
   * them, while an opaque accent tone reintroduces the problem this prop exists
   * to solve.
