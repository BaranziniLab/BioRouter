/**
 * The left sidebar's width: its bounds, its clamp, and the stored preference.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE. The sidebar was a fixed `15rem` written once
 * inside a React component, and the number leaked: `main.ts` derives the OS
 * window's `minWidth` from it, and `styles/measures.test.ts` re-parses it out of
 * the component's source to assert that derivation still holds. Now that the
 * width is a range rather than a value, three files reason about the same three
 * numbers, and a copy that drifted would let the window be sized narrow enough
 * for the sidebar to squeeze the 760px reading column — a layout bug jsdom
 * cannot see, because it computes no layout.
 *
 * So the numbers and the arithmetic live here, free of React and the DOM, the
 * way `useArtifactPanel`'s clamp and `utils/messageClamp.ts`'s thresholds do.
 * Everything below is a pure function of its arguments (the storage helpers take
 * their storage), which is what makes the bounds provable in a unit test rather
 * than only observable by dragging the real app.

 * The floor. 10% under the 240px the sidebar shipped at — narrow enough to buy
 * back a meaningful slice of the canvas, wide enough that a chat title is still
 * a title rather than a truncation. It is also the number the OS window's
 * `minWidth` is derived from (`main.ts`), because the window must stay able to
 * seat the NARROWEST sidebar beside a full reading column; anything wider than
 * this is the user's own choice, made with the window already open.
