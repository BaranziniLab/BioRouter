/**
 * The legend dock (ui-spec §4.7).
 *
 * ⚠ **Four credibility entries, not seven, and that is DR-9b's honesty clause
 * made visible.** The canvas draws four *distinguishable* ring treatments — four
 * arcs, one arc, dashed, solid-with-`!` — because a 1.6px stroke subtends 2–3
 * arcmin and the seven ring hues collapse to ΔE00 1.13 under tritanopia. The old
 * legend listed seven treatments against a four-entry key, so `web` and
 * `personal` had no row at all. They are one category here — *not academic* —
 * and the exact tier lives in the inspector and the Source facet.
 *
 * ⚠ **Every chip is a real `<button>`, via `Badge asChild`.** Wrapping a badge
 * in a raw button would defeat D-15: the global focus rule paints
 * `background-color: var(--background-focus)` on the focused control, and a
 * `tone="neutral"` badge is an OPAQUE `bg-background-medium` that covers it
 * completely — a keyboard user would get no focus indication on any legend chip.
 * With `asChild` the chip *is* the button and takes the focus surface directly.
