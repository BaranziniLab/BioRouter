/**
 * ONE resolver, and that is a requirement rather than a style note (ui-spec §5.11).
 *
 * A canvas cannot parse `var(--…)`: `ctx.font` and `ctx.fillStyle` are parsed
 * against the canvas element, not the cascade, so the assignment is silently
 * DROPPED and the previous value stays. Reading the custom property by name does
 * not help either — `getPropertyValue('--text-default')` returns the *declared*
 * value, which in the dark blocks is itself `var(--color-neutral-100)`, another
 * reference the canvas cannot resolve. **Only the used value is safe.**
 *
 * ⚠ **The two guards below are the whole point, and this file has already been
 * burned by writing them twice.** Before this rewrite there were two resolvers:
 * `resolveCanvasInk` rejected `var(`, `resolveCanvasFontFamily` did not — and
 * BOTH were covered by a test named "never hands a canvas an unresolved custom
 * property". One of them was not actually guarded; the case passed because a
 * computed `fontFamily` happens never to be a `var()`, not because the code
 * prevented it. Two resolvers had already diverged, and §5.11 adds five more
 * fields. So there is exactly one function, and every field goes through it.
