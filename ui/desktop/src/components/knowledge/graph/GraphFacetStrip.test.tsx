   * It used to assert that the readout and its undo sat OUTSIDE a horizontal
   * scroller while the pickers sat inside it — a fix for the measured failure
   * where one active facet put 769px of content in a 550px box and pushed both
   * off the right edge. That fix cured the symptom and left the pickers
   * themselves scrolling out of sight.
   *
   * There is now no scroller at all: the row degrades by priority into `More`
   * and then `Filters`, so every control stays reachable at every width. The
   * assertion is therefore that NOTHING in the strip scrolls sideways, which is
   * strictly stronger than the old one. Nothing in jsdom can measure overflow,
   * so this stays STRUCTURAL — the container-query steps themselves need a real
   * browser (see `.knowledge-harness`).
