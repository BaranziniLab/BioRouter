/**
 * The two brand components take DELIBERATELY OPPOSITE approaches to theming,
 * and both directions have been broken before:
 *
 *   BioRouterMark      follows the family. It used to hold fixed constants
 *                      while the boot splash was family-aware, so Roche Limit
 *                      flashed an orange monogram and then hydrated a Parchment
 *                      coral/navy one.
 *   BioRouterWordmark  does NOT follow the family. It is the brand lockup and
 *                      stays in the brand's colours whichever palette the app
 *                      wears — the same way a logo does on a coloured page.
 *
 * Without these tests the pair reads as an inconsistency, and someone
 * "fixes" whichever one they noticed second. That is exactly how the mark and
 * the splash drifted apart the first time.
