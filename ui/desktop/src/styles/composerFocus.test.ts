/**
 * The composer's focus edge: the input's own 1px border turns the brand accent
 * while you are typing in it.
 *
 * ⚠ **This is asserted at the SOURCE, and it has to be.** jsdom has no layout
 * engine, never runs Tailwind, and does not evaluate `:has()` — so a component
 * test can mount the composer, focus the textarea, read `borderColor`, and see
 * the resting value in every case, passing identically whether the rule exists
 * or not. The only thing assertable here is the declaration, so that is what is
 * asserted. Verified in a real browser when it landed: focused border computes
 * to `rgb(184, 90, 50)` = `#b85a32` = `--border-accent` in Parchment light.
 *
 * ⚠ **Why the rule is authored CSS rather than a Tailwind variant at the call
 * site — do not "simplify" it back.** Three spellings were tried on the element
 * (`has-[textarea:focus-visible]:border-border-accent`,
 * `has-[textarea:focus]:inset-shadow-accent`, and
 * `has-[textarea:focus]:border-border-accent`) and only the first ever reached
 * the stylesheet. Each was measured in the running app: the class was on the
 * element, the textarea was a focused descendant, and no matching rule existed.
 * Clearing `node_modules/.vite` did not change it. The renderer runs with
 * `watch: { ignored: ['**'] }` under `BIOROUTER_NO_HMR`, which is the signal
 * Tailwind's scanner uses to notice new class strings — so a *newly written*
 * utility can silently fail to generate. A focus indicator must not depend on
 * class-scanning having worked.
 *
 * ⚠ **`--border-accent`, never `--accent-muted`.** `--accent-muted` is the
 * accent at 8%; 2px of it reads as a thick warm-grey band, not an orange edge,
 * and it was reported that way twice ("a very thick rim", then "not orange, a
 * thick border"). The accent proper is what makes this read as the brand.
