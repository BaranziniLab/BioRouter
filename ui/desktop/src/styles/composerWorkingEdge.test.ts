/**
 * The composer's WORKING edge: while a turn runs, the card's own 1px border
 * carries a travelling segment of the brand accent.
 *
 * It replaced a row above the composer holding a breathing dot, which was
 * byte-identical to `TurnActivityIndicator`'s, sat 8px out of line with it
 * (each anchored to a different grid), and cost a ~34px layout shift on Send.
 *
 * ⚠ **Asserted at the SOURCE, like its sibling `composerFocus.test.ts`, and for
 * the same reason.** jsdom has no layout engine, never runs Tailwind, does not
 * evaluate `:has()`, does not resolve `color-mix()`, and does not run
 * `@property`-registered animations. A component test can mount the composer,
 * set the working state, read `borderColor` and see the resting value in every
 * case — passing identically whether any of this exists or not. The only thing
 * assertable here is the declaration.
 *
 * Verified in a real browser when it landed (Chrome, compiled tokens):
 *  - `[data-working]` present   -> `::after` animates `br-composer-working`
 *  - focused + working          -> base border resolves to a 30% accent mix
 *  - focused + idle             -> base border resolves to the full accent
 *  - `prefers-reduced-motion`   -> `animation-name: none`, ring stays dashed
