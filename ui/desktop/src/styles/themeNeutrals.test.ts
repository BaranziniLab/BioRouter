/**
 * The three families share ONE set of neutrals and differ only in ink and
 * accent. This is the guard for that, and it exists because **nothing else
 * checks it**.
 *
 * `check-contrast.mjs` audits each family independently — it asks whether a
 * family's own ink is legible on that family's own ground. A family that
 * quietly re-tuned its greys would pass all 330 of those assertions, because
 * each one would still be internally consistent. The property that actually
 * matters here is a property BETWEEN families, and nothing was measuring it.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical: three hand-tuned neutral sets is where this
 * started. Alma Mater's greys were cool blue, Roche Limit's warm, Parchment's
 * cream, and of the background/border/sidebar keys in the light block Alma and
 * Roche agreed on only four. Every new surface had to be checked three times
 * and still drifted. The fix was to make neutrals shared infrastructure; this
 * test is what keeps them that way.
 *
 * ⚠ **An allowlist, not a blocklist, and that direction is the point.** A new
 * token defaults to "must be identical across all three". If it genuinely
 * belongs to a family, it has to be added below — a deliberate act with a
 * reason attached, rather than a divergence nobody noticed. Getting a failure
 * here is the system working; the fix is usually to make the token match, not
 * to add it to the list.
