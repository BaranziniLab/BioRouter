/**
 * The Knowledge pane's container-query ladder, asserted AT THE SOURCE.
 *
 * ⚠ **jsdom cannot catch what this guards.** It has no layout engine and does
 * not evaluate `@container` at all, so a component test renders every step
 * simultaneously and measures nothing — the two real overflow seams this ladder
 * has had were both found by sweeping pane widths in a browser and were both
 * invisible to the suite. This file therefore does what `styles/measures.test.ts`
 * and `styles/toastLayer.test.ts` do: assert the declaration itself.
 *
 * ⚠ **A `@container` condition cannot read a custom property.** The thresholds
 * exist twice on purpose — once as a documented token, once as the literal the
 * query actually obeys — and drift between the two is silent, because the token
 * is inert. Pinning them together is the whole point of the first test.
