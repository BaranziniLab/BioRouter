/**
 * biorouterPaths.ts — the ONE place the main process derives Biorouter's
 * config directory.
 *
 * ⚠ **Every main-process consumer must come through here.** Issue #146 was
 * fixed once, in `extensionUpdater.ts`, and left four other derivations of
 * `~/.config/biorouter` standing — including the two in the `brxt:uninstall`
 * handler, which feed `fsSync.rmSync(installDir, { recursive: true, force:
 * true })`. A sandboxed dev build could therefore recursively delete out of the
 * developer's real extensions tree. A second resolver "kept in step" is the
 * shape that bug had; there is one function, and its callers pass it on.
 *
 * ## What it must agree with
 *
 * The authority is Rust: `crates/biorouter/src/config/paths.rs`
 * (`Paths::get_dir`), which the daemon, the CLI and every in-process store read
 * through. It resolves in two steps, and both were wrong here:
 *
 * 1. **`BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT`** — the sandbox seam. `<root>/config`, the shape
 *    `main.ts` already used for `config.yaml`.
 * 2. Otherwise the **platform** directory, via `etcetera`'s
 *    `choose_app_strategy` with `{author: "Block", app_name: "biorouter"}`.
 *    That is the **Xdg** strategy on macOS as well as Linux (verified in
 *    etcetera 0.11's `app_strategy.rs`: `create_strategies!(Apple, Xdg)` puts
 *    Xdg in the `choose_app_strategy` slot), and the **Windows** strategy on
 *    Windows. It is NOT `~/.config/biorouter` on either count: a non-default
 *    `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` moves it, and Windows has never used that layout.
 *    `crates/biorouter-server/src/routes/shell.rs` fixed and documented the
 *    same defect on the Rust side.
 *
 * ## The empty-string decision
 *
 * A set-but-blank `BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT` was read three different ways —
 * `Paths::get_dir` takes it literally and yields a **cwd-relative** `./config`,
 * `biorouter-mcp::resolve_config_dir` treats it as unset, and this module used
 * to ignore the variable entirely. Blank is treated as **unset** here, and the
 * reason is not taste:
 *
 * - A relative config dir has no cross-process meaning. The daemon is spawned
 *   with a working directory of its own, so `./config` names a *different*
 *   directory in the daemon than in the Electron main process, whatever this
 *   module does. Mirroring `Paths` byte-for-byte would therefore NOT restore
 *   agreement — it would point a recursive-delete writer at
 *   `<electron cwd>/config/extensions`, which for a packaged app is not even
 *   inside the user's home.
 * - "Set but empty means unset" is already what every other resolver on both
 *   sides of the boundary does: `biorouter-mcp::resolve_config_dir`,
 *   `routes::shell::home_dir` (`.filter(|p| !p.as_os_str().is_empty())`), and
 *   `main.ts`'s own `expandBiorouterPath`, whose `if (!pathRoot)` has always
 *   made an empty string falsy.
 *
 * ⚠ **This leaves `Paths::get_dir` as the odd one out**, and it is the half
 * that cannot be fixed from here: with the variable exported but empty the
 * daemon still writes `./config`. The fix is one line in `paths.rs`
 * (`std::env::var(…).ok().filter(|root| !root.trim().is_empty())`), and until
 * it lands, an empty `BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT` is a broken sandbox no matter what
 * this file does — not a reason to point the writers at the real tree.
