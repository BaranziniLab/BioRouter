/**
 * Which shell is this renderer running inside — the desktop application, or an
 * ordinary web browser pointed at `biorouter serve`?
 *
 * The two surfaces are not equally capable, and the difference is deliberate.
 * `docs/deployment/serve-decisions.md` **SD-1** rules that a browser session
 * cannot change its model or provider: the daemon a `serve` session talks to is
 * started with no proof-of-user mechanism (SD-7), so every write to a
 * capability config key — `POST /config/set_provider`, and `/config/upsert` or
 * `/config/remove` on `BIOROUTER_PROVIDER` and its four siblings — is refused
 * with a 409 by the privacy boundary in issue #56 (DR-16).
 *
 * That refusal is the feature, not a bug to route around. What SD-1 also
 * requires is that *"the interface must explain the refusal rather than appear
 * broken. A disabled picker with a reason is the requirement; a 409 toast is
 * not."* — the refusal body is addressed to an AI agent and tells the reader to
 * go and use the desktop application, which is no help at all to a human in a
 * browser. This module is how a control finds out that it should explain
 * itself **before** the user reaches the refusal.
 *
 * ⚠ **Detection reads the DOM, not a module-level snapshot.** `renderer.tsx`
 * stamps the marker below onto `<html>` at the moment it installs the browser
 * shim, which is before React mounts but *after* this module may have been
 * evaluated. A value captured at import time would therefore be read too early
 * and would answer `desktop` on the very surface this exists to detect.
 *
 * ⚠ **The marker is on `<html>`, not on `<body>`.** `renderer.tsx` sets both,
 * and the body class is what stylesheets hook; the `documentElement` dataset is
 * what code should ask, because it survives anything that replaces the body.

 * same reason). The attribute value is left alone so a page served by an older
 * daemon still identifies itself; the *type* above uses the current word.

 * config editor (`settings/config/ConfigSettings.tsx`) renders every non-secret
 * key as an editable field, and only these five 409 — so a blanket disable
 * there would be wrong about most of the page. Nothing enforces the agreement:
 * if a key is added to the Rust constant it must be added here too, and the
 * cost of missing one is a Save button that still produces the agent-facing
 * 409 this whole change exists to replace. Every *other* surface touched by
 * this change asks {@link isBrowserSurface} instead, because each of them
