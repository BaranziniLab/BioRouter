/**
 * Issue #146 — the main process derived Biorouter's config directory in five
 * places, and they did not agree.
 *
 * `extensionUpdater.ts` built `~/.config/biorouter/extensions` into a
 * module-level constant, ignoring `BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT`. It is not a read-only
 * module — it extracts a downloaded `.brxt` over `installDir` and then runs
 * `uv sync` there — and it fires on a timer 15 s after every launch, so a
 * sandboxed dev build enumerated (and would have rewritten) the developer's
 * nine real extensions.
 *
 * ⚠ Fixing that module alone left the WORSE sites standing: `main.ts`'s
 * `brxt:uninstall` handler derived the same path from `os.homedir()` and handed
 * it to `fsSync.rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true })`, `brxt:install`
 * did the same before extracting an archive into it, and
 * `extensionProvenance.ts` wrote its store there. (`renderer.tsx`'s browser
 * shim had a fifth, `${home_dir}/.config/biorouter`, with no callers at all;
 * it was deleted rather than rewired.) There is now ONE resolver —
 * `utils/biorouterPaths.ts` — and the last describe block below is what stops
 * the next derivation appearing.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST CATCHES. Some are behavioural — they drive the real
 * `runExtensionUpdateCheck` against a fake home — and the rest are resolution
 * or source assertions, for the facts no behavioural test in this file can see.
