//! Task 46 (issue #56, DR-26): which institution's agreements cover the model a
//! session is bound to, and the two predicates that decide it.
//!
//! Affiliation is a **sibling of [`Provider::tier`]**, not a member of
//! `privacy/`: tier is a trait method on `Provider` whose deciding logic lives
//! in three free functions in `providers/mod.rs`, and affiliation answers the
//! second question — *under whose agreements?* — from the same inputs. The
//! vocabulary it answers in lives in `privacy::affiliation`; the *decision*
//! lives here, beside the tier decision it must never contradict.
//!
//! Declared in `providers/mod.rs` as `#[cfg(test)] mod affiliation_tests;` —
//! **not** `include!`, or the filter `providers::affiliation_tests` resolves to
//! nothing and prints `0 passed`.
//!
//! The **completeness** half of this task is deliberately not here. It
//! enumerates what `factory::register_builtin_providers` registers, so it sits
//! directly beneath that function in `providers/factory.rs`, where the person
//! adding a provider is already looking.
