//! BR-50: an optional self-critique / reflection pass on ordinary answers.
//!
//! Nothing re-reads the agent's own answer for correctness, contradiction, or
//! hallucination before it is returned to the user — the science-accuracy
//! mandate in `system.md` has no enforcement point. Judges exist only for
//! `/goal` (a Stop-hook evaluator, see [`crate::agents::goal`]) and for
//! permissions. This module adds a *cheap, opt-in* critique that reuses the
//! same LLM-as-judge primitive the goal loop uses
//! ([`crate::hooks::prompt_runner::run_prompt_hook`]) rather than inventing a
//! new one.
//!
//! When an ordinary turn is about to finish (no `/goal` is active — a goal
//! already runs its own Stop-hook judge), an enabled critique runs one fast
//! judge over the recent transcript. If it finds a *clear, verifiable* problem
//! it returns a concrete correction, which the reply loop feeds back to the
//! model as one corrective pass; the model revises, then finishes. The pass
//! count is bounded per reply so a stubborn answer cannot spin.
//!
//! **Config-gated and default OFF.** It costs one extra LLM call per turn (a
//! fast-model judge), so it never runs unless a user opts in:
//! `BIOROUTER_SELF_CRITIQUE=true`. The corrective-pass ceiling is
//! `BIOROUTER_SELF_CRITIQUE_MAX_PASSES` (default 1). The judge deliberately
//! biases toward "answer is fine" so an enabled critique adds at most one round
//! trip on a healthy answer, never an open-ended loop.

     is a science-accuracy safeguard, not a style review.\n\n\
     IMPORTANT — how to read the evidence:\n\
     • The event JSON's `transcript_tail` is only a RECENT EXCERPT of the \
     conversation. Earlier context and tool output have scrolled out of view. Do \
     NOT treat \"I can't see the supporting work in this excerpt\" as an error — \
     judge only what is actually present.\n\
     • Judge the substance of the final answer, not its formatting, length, or \
     tone.\n\n\
     Respond {\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"<one concrete, specific correction>\"} \
     ONLY when the answer has a clear, verifiable defect, such as:\n\
     • a factual or scientific error (a wrong gene/drug/dose, a mis-stated \
     mechanism, a mathematical or unit mistake);\n\
     • an internal contradiction (the answer asserts two incompatible things);\n\
     • a fabricated specific — a citation, statistic, identifier, or quantitative \
     claim stated with confidence but unsupported by anything in the transcript;\n\
     • a conclusion the transcript's own tool results directly refute.\n\
     The `reason` must name the specific problem and what to fix, so the agent \
     can correct it in one pass.\n\n\
     Respond {\"ok\": true} in EVERY other case, including: the answer is sound; \
     it is a reasonable judgment call, an opinion, or an appropriately hedged \
     estimate; it is merely incomplete or could go deeper; or you are unsure \
     whether something is actually wrong. When in doubt, respond {\"ok\": true} — \
     do NOT invent problems, and do NOT ask for more detail. A correct answer \
     must never be sent back."
