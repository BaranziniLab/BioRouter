//! Why a turn ended without doing its job.
//!
//! Before this existed, a turn that *failed* and a turn that *succeeded* were
//! indistinguishable to every consumer of the agent stream. A provider 403 was
//! downgraded into an assistant chat message ("Ran into this error: …") and the
//! stream then ended **normally**, so:
//!
//!   * `biorouter run` exited **0**,
//!   * `--output-format json` reported `"status": "completed"`,
//!   * telemetry logged the failed run as a **success**,
//!   * and the desktop/app runtimes rendered a finished turn.
//!
//! The only way to recover "did the turn actually run?" was to regex the English
//! prose the model-facing layer emitted. This makes the failure a typed, terminal
//! event that every boundary — CLI exit code, JSON status, SSE frame, WS frame —
//! can check mechanically.
//!
//! Wave 4 adds [`TurnAbortCode::ToolLoop`] and [`TurnAbortCode::WorkerTimeout`]
//! through the same channel.
