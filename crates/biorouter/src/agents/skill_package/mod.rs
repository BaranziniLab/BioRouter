//! One import pipeline for skill packages (#115).
//!
//! # The failure this replaces
//!
//! Given a repository URL, BioRouter had no repository-aware installer, so an
//! agent improvised with shell and file copies and produced one unrelated
//! top-level skill per `SKILL.md`. For a coordinated package such as
//! [HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) — a declared plugin
//! with 20 component skills and a mandatory `hyperframes` router — flattening
//! discards **behaviour**, not merely grouping: the entry-point relationship,
//! the core-versus-on-demand distinction, the package's identity, coordinated
//! updates, and install/remove as one unit.
//!
//! The ZIP path was no better. Both the daemon and the CLI recognised exactly
//! three shapes — `SKILL.md`, `<skill>/SKILL.md`, `<bundle>/<skill>/SKILL.md` —
//! by counting slashes, and read no manifest at all. A normal GitHub source
//! archive is `<repo>-<ref>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, which matches none of them.
//!
//! # The rules this module is built on
//!
//! **Metadata beats shape.** The detection ladder is
//! [`manifest::detect`]: a BioRouter package manifest, then
//! `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`'s skills path, then a compatible
//! `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, then `skills-manifest.json`, and only then
//! structural inference. A rung that fires records *which* rung it was, so the
//! preview can say why it thinks what it thinks.
//!
//! **A shared name prefix is never the signal.** HyperFrames' members include
//! `media-use`, `slideshow`, `product-launch-video` and `faceless-explainer`,
//! none of which begin with `hyperframes-`. Detection uses structure and
//! manifests, and every component keeps its declared name exactly — no prefix
//! is added as a grouping mechanism, because the frontmatter `name` is the
//! identifier every enablement surface keys on.
//!
//! **Ambiguity is a question, not a default.** When no manifest speaks and the
//! structure alone could mean either one package or several unrelated skills,
//! [`ImportPlan::ambiguity`] is set and the caller must choose. Flattening by
//! default is the behaviour this issue exists to remove.
//!
//! **A partial write never lands.** [`install::install`] stages the whole
//! package in a sibling directory and swaps it in with renames, so a failure
//! anywhere leaves either the previous version or nothing — never half a
//! package.
