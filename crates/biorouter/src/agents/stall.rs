//! Progress-stall detection for ordinary chat (BR-32).
//!
//! BioRouter already had genuinely good local-minimum detection — fuzzy
//! similarity of an LLM judge's feedback across attempts, a stall counter that
//! does **not** reset when tools run, and a graceful give-up — but it lived
//! entirely inside the `/goal` Stop-hook loop ([`super::goal`]) and therefore
//! never ran for ordinary chat, which is where most stuck loops actually happen.
//!
//! This module generalizes that machinery:
//!
//! * [`reason_similarity`] / [`similar_reasons`] — the Jaccard word-set
//!   similarity that used to be private to `goal.rs`; the goal loop now uses
//!   this copy, so the two can never drift.
//! * [`StallWatch`] — the goal's `stall_count` / `last_reason` bookkeeping,
//!   lifted out of `GoalState` into a reusable tracker with an explicit
//!   [`StallAction`] outcome (nudge → give up), mirroring `GoalOutcome`.
//! * [`check_progress`] — a *periodic* "are you looping?" LLM check over a
//!   compact transcript tail (Gemini CLI's periodic loop check), run from the
//!   reply loop for **every** session, not just goal sessions.
//!
//! ## Why periodic, and why it's cheap
//!
//! An always-on LLM loop check would add a provider round-trip to every
//! iteration of every turn. Instead the check only starts once a single turn has
//! already run [`DEFAULT_STALL_CHECK_AFTER`] actions without returning to the
//! user (30 — normal chat never gets there; a stuck agentic turn does), and then
//! only every [`DEFAULT_STALL_CHECK_EVERY`] actions (10). It runs on the
//! provider's *fast* model when one is configured (like prompt hooks), sees only
//! a bounded tail, and is fail-open: any provider error, timeout or unparseable
//! verdict is treated as "no evidence of a loop".
//!
//! ## Staged response (mirrors BR-29's soft-then-hard shape)
//!
//! 1. First "you're looping" verdict → a **nudge**: a model-visible message
//!    naming the loop and demanding a different approach. Nothing is blocked.
//! 2. The checker keeps flagging the *same* loop ([`StallCheckConfig::stall_limit`]
//!    near-identical reasons in a row) or flags any loop
//!    [`StallCheckConfig::max_flags`] times → **give up**: the model is told to
//!    stop and hand the user a best-effort answer, and the turn is hard-bounded
//!    to a short grace period after that so a model that ignores the instruction
//!    cannot keep spinning to the `max_turns` cap.
//!
//! Everything is config-gated: `BIOROUTER_STALL_CHECK=false` turns the whole
//! thing off, and each threshold has its own key (see [`StallCheckConfig::from_config`]).
