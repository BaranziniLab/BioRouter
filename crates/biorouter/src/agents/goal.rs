//! Session goals (`/goal`, Claude Code-style).
//!
//! `/goal <condition>` registers a session-scoped Stop hook whose LLM judge
//! evaluates the condition every time the agent tries to finish its turn. If
//! the condition is not met, the stop is blocked and the judge's feedback is
//! fed back to the model, so the agent keeps working until the condition holds.
//!
//! Robustness (see the `/Users/wgu/Downloads/hook failure.json` case that
//! motivated it — a "summarize all 400 sites in chat" goal that looped
//! forever):
//!
//! 1. **Truncation-aware judging.** The judge only ever sees a recent
//!    `transcript_tail`, never the whole conversation. A goal that emits a
//!    large volume in-chat will always look "incomplete" in the tail, so the
//!    judge rule explicitly forbids treating "output not fully visible in this
//!    excerpt" as proof the work wasn't done — it must verify the *deliverable
//!    / end state*, not require the entire output inline.
//! 2. **A real iteration cap.** The generic Stop-hook block cap resets on every
//!    tool call ([`crate::hooks::STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`]); a goal agent always
//!    runs a tool before stopping, so that cap never fires. Goals therefore
//!    keep their own iteration counter in [`GoalState`] that does NOT reset on
//!    tool calls, bounded by [`GOAL_MAX_ITERATIONS`].
//! 3. **Stall detection.** If the judge keeps returning essentially the same
//!    feedback ([`GOAL_STALL_LIMIT`] times running), the loop is not
//!    converging and is stopped early.
//! 4. **Graceful give-up.** When the cap or a stall is hit, the goal is cleared
//!    and the agent is told to deliver its best-effort answer (what it did,
//!    what's incomplete, the blocker) instead of spinning — control returns to
//!    the user rather than looping indefinitely.

         work wasn't done.\n\
         • Verify the DELIVERABLE / end state, not whether the entire output is pasted \
         inline. Evidence of completion includes the agent reporting it finished with \
         concrete results (counts, a saved file path, a clear final answer), tool \
         results showing success, or work products written to disk.\n\
         • If the user has since relaxed or clarified the goal in the transcript, honor \
         that relaxed version.\n\n\
         Respond {{\"ok\": true}} (let the agent stop) when ANY of these hold:\n\
         • the goal is verifiably met or substantially satisfied;\n\
         • the agent is blocked on something only the user can resolve (it asked a \
         question, a permission was denied);\n\
         • the goal cannot be satisfied as literally specified (e.g. it would require \
         far more output than fits in chat), OR the agent has stopped making real \
         progress across attempts — in these cases returning control to the user with a \
         best-effort answer is the right outcome.\n\n\
         Respond {{\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"<short, concrete next step>\"}} ONLY when \
         the goal is genuinely not met AND a specific, different action would move it \
         forward. When in doubt after several attempts, prefer {{\"ok\": true}} — do not \
         keep the agent looping."
