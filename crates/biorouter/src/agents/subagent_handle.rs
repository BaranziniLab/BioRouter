//! Async subagent handles (BR-40, second half).
//!
//! Wave 1 landed the structured result envelope ([`crate::agents::subagent_result`]);
//! this is the other half of the proposal: a **spawn → poll** model, so a long
//! subagent no longer stalls the parent's turn.
//!
//! A `subagent` call with `background: true` creates the child session, spawns
//! the run on a detached task, registers a [`BackgroundSubagent`] here, and
//! returns the child's *session id* to the parent immediately. The parent then
//! waits on it with `workspace_watch` (or reads it with
//! `workspace_read_conversation`) to collect the same [`SubagentResult`]
//! envelope it would have got synchronously.
//!
//! Invariants worth knowing:
//!
//! * **The parent's cancellation token is not inherited.** A background child
//!   outlives the turn that spawned it by design, so it gets a fresh token —
//!   otherwise the parent's turn ending would kill the very thing that was made
//!   detachable. The token is reachable through the handle (`workspace_close`,
//!   BR-71 decision 23's replacement for the old poll tool's `cancel: true`) and
//!   through the BR-42 active-work view, which
//!   [`crate::agents::subagent_handler::run_complete_subagent_task`] registers.
//! * **The fork-bomb guards still apply.** The in-flight counter is incremented
//!   before the spawn (so a storm of background spawns is refused just like a
//!   storm of blocking ones) and the concurrency semaphore is acquired *inside*
//!   the detached task, so background work queues rather than bypassing the cap.
//! * **Handles are process-local and in-memory.** The child *session* is
//!   persisted as always, but a handle does not survive a restart; a poll after
//!   a restart reports the handle as unknown rather than inventing a result.
//! * **Off by default.** `BIOROUTER_SUBAGENT_BACKGROUND` (config or env) gates
//!   the `subagent` tool's `background` parameter, so the default tool surface
//!   and the default blocking behaviour are unchanged. Since BR-71 decision 23
//!   it gates *only* that parameter: collecting a detached child is done with
//!   the workspace tools, which are advertised on their own terms.
