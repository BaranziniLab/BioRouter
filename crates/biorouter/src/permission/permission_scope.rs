//! BR-24: per-directory / per-command-prefix permission scoping — the *matching*
//! semantics, kept pure and separately testable because they are the security
//! core of the feature.
//!
//! Before this module a remembered approval had exactly two grades, both bad:
//!
//! * `ToolPermissionStore` keyed the grant on `blake3(tool_name + exact-JSON
//!   args)`, so it only ever fired again on a byte-identical repeat call; and
//! * `PermissionLevel::AlwaysAllow` whitelisted the **tool name**, so "always
//!   allow `shell`" blessed every future shell command the model could think of,
//!   `rm -rf` included.
//!
//! Neither expresses the thing users actually want — "stop asking me about
//! `git status`", "stop asking me about edits inside this repo" — so they reach
//! for the blanket grant, which is precisely the approval-fatigue failure mode
//! BR-18 set out to reduce.
//!
//! This module adds the two intermediate grades:
//!
//! * [`PermissionScope::Directory`] — every filesystem path the call names lies
//!   inside one canonical directory.
//! * [`PermissionScope::CommandPrefix`] — the call's command line begins with an
//!   exact sequence of shell **tokens**.
//!
//! # Why the matching is as paranoid as it is
//!
//! An over-broad remembered approval is strictly worse than no feature at all:
//! it is a silent, persistent grant the user believes is narrow. Every rule here
//! therefore fails **closed** — an input we cannot fully understand simply does
//! not match, and the user is prompted as before:
//!
//! * **Directory containment is component-wise, on canonicalized paths.** A grant
//!   for `/work/a` must not authorize `/work/ab` (a plain string prefix would),
//!   nor `/work/a/../../etc/passwd`, nor a symlink inside `/work/a` that points
//!   out of it. [`Path::starts_with`] is component-wise, and both sides go
//!   through `canonicalize`, which resolves `..` and symlinks. A path that does
//!   not exist yet (the target of a write) is resolved against its deepest
//!   existing ancestor; a `..` we cannot resolve that way aborts the resolution.
//! * **A directory grant never authorizes a command.** A shell command line can
//!   touch anything, anywhere, and we do not parse it; "allow in this directory"
//!   is therefore only ever matched against tools whose *arguments* name paths.
//! * **Command prefixes match whole tokens, never substrings.** A grant for
//!   `git status` must not authorize `git push`, nor `git statusfoo`.
//! * **Only "simple" commands can match a prefix at all.** `git status && rm -rf
//!   /` starts with the tokens `git status`; matching a prefix against it would
//!   be a catastrophic over-grant. Any command containing a shell control
//!   operator, a substitution, a redirection or a leading assignment is refused
//!   outright and falls back to a prompt.
//! * **The tool surface is an allowlist.** A scope is only ever matched against
//!   tools whose argument shape is known here. An unrecognised tool yields no
//!   facts, so no scope can match it.
