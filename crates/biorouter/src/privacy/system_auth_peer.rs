//! Is the process on the other end of this socket code we signed?
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The macOS prompt is raised by a separate helper (see
//! `biorouter-authprompt`), so its answer has to travel back over local IPC —
//! and a local channel can be written by anything running as the same user. The
//! first version used a nonce in a `0600` file, which raises the bar from
//! "guess a path" to "read the daemon's private directory" and no further: an
//! agent with shell access clears both, and the operations behind this prompt
//! include *turning privacy enforcement off*. A forged approval there is an
//! escalation, not a skipped dialog.
//!
//! So the daemon asks the **kernel** which process is connected
//! (`LOCAL_PEERPID`), and then asks **Security.framework** whether that process
//! is signed by our Developer ID team. Forging now requires a binary signed by
//! `F3YYBXAFJ8`, which a shell script is not.
//!
//! ⚠ **What this still does not stop.** Someone who can debug or inject into a
//! process we did sign, or who holds the signing key, defeats it. It is a
//! meaningful bar, not an unforgeable one — and Biorouter's privacy barrier is
//! documented as safety rather than security for exactly this class of reason.
//! Do not upgrade the claim in the docs on the strength of this file.
//!
//! ⚠ **PID reuse is why the check happens on a CONNECTED socket.** A pid
//! obtained any other way can be recycled between learning it and checking it;
//! `LOCAL_PEERPID` on a live connection names the process holding that end
//! right now, and the connection is kept open across the check.
