//! Affiliation — the third axis (DR-26). *Under whose agreements?*
//!
//! [`super::ProviderTier`] asks how sensitive a thing is. Affiliation asks a
//! different question, and the two do not compose: a HIPAA-compliant LLM
//! approved at one institution has **no** blanket permission over another
//! institution's PHI. Compliance is established per data flow — by BAAs,
//! subcontractor chains, IRB approvals and DUAs — and it does not transfer
//! because both endpoints happen to be called "private". UCSF's Versa reaching
//! the UCSF OMOP agent is the arrangement everyone approved; the same Versa
//! model reaching another institution's connector is a cross-institutional
//! linkage nobody papered. Both pass every tier gate this campaign built, which
//! is why this cannot be expressed by subdividing the tier lattice.
//!
//! This module is the vocabulary, the single comparison, and the words a
//! mismatch is stated in. It decides nothing on its own: a mismatch **warns and
//! asks**, it does not block (DR-19 applied to the third axis), and the grant
//! and the gates that consult them are the tasks that follow.
//!
//! [`cross_affiliation_warning`] lives here rather than beside a gate because
//! DR-26 makes the warning the product: it must name both institutions
//! specifically enough for the user to act on, and a copy composed at each gate
//! would drift into the shrug ("this may be a compliance risk") the ruling
//! rejects.
//!
//! ⚠ **The inversion to get right.** [`ModelAffiliation::Local`] is the *most*
//! permissive value, not a peer of the institutions — see [`compatible`].
