/// no `&self` (`extension_manager.rs`'s dispatch future, `agent.rs`'s wrapper).
///
/// It exists because the capability decision has FOUR readers on one call's
/// path — the Agent seam, Gate C, the built-in `_meta` bit, and the Platform
/// extensions — and every one of them used to re-read the provider mutex at a
/// different program point. `Agent::update_provider` takes that mutex, assigns
/// and drops it with no turn lock and no generation counter, and `biorouterd`
/// runs the multi-thread runtime, so the swap and a dispatch genuinely run in
/// parallel. Worse, the last of those reads happens *inside the driven future*,
/// past `tool_dispatch_limits::acquire` — an unbounded wall-clock gap, not
/// microseconds. Any read-then-read of shared mutable state across two program
/// points is a race; so there is one read, and it is carried.
///
/// The master toggle is a second axis with the identical defect, which is why
/// it is captured here too rather than re-read per gate: without that, one call
/// could pass Gate C with tiers **on** and then build an empty path policy with
/// tiers **off**.
///
/// **What this does NOT close** is AR-13: the sample is taken at *permit* time
/// and the tool runs later, so threading makes the call *consistent* — all
/// consumers agree — not *current*. Re-sampling at execution time to fix that
/// is exactly the bug, because it is what lets a Public-admitted call run
/// Private.
///
/// ⚠ **`affiliation` must stay [`Copy`]-compatible.** DR-26's third axis rides
/// here rather than being looked up per gate, and the natural encodings for it
/// — a `BTreeSet<String>` of institutions, or an owned `String` id — would break
