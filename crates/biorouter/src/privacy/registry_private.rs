//! **Generated file — do not edit by hand.**
//!
//! `landing/scripts/build-registry.mjs` writes this in the same run as
//! `landing/registry.json` and the desktop fallback snapshot, from the
//! `data-privacy` / `data-extension-name` / `data-affiliation` annotations on
//! the extension cards in `landing/baam.html`. Regenerate all three with:
//!
//! ```text
//! node landing/scripts/build-registry.mjs
//! ```
//!
//! The set has to live in Rust: there is no network path to the registry from
//! here (the only fetch is the Electron `main.ts` `registry:fetch` handler), so
//! without this file the CLI and the daemon can enforce nothing.
//!
//! Drift between the three is detectable, not merely discouraged:
//!
//! ```text
//! node landing/scripts/build-registry.mjs --check
//! ```
//!
//! regenerates all three in memory and fails if any committed copy differs. It
//! runs in CI (the Frontend workflow) and in `just check-everything`, so a hand
//! edit here — or an interrupted run that updated only some of the three — is
//! caught rather than trusted not to happen.
//!
//! Each const carries `#[rustfmt::skip]` so that `--check` above is the only
//! authority on its layout. rustfmt wraps a slice literal by `array_width`
//! (60 columns between the brackets), not by `max_width`, and a generator that
//! predicted the wrong one produced text `cargo fmt --check` rejected and
//! `--check` demanded — two gates in `just check-everything` with no state
//! satisfying both, over the file whose header forbids the obvious way out.
