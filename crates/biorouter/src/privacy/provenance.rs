//! Where an installed extension came from — issue #56, [DR-23].
//!
//! DR-23 says an extension's tier is **re-derived from the registry at read
//! time, keyed on a stable identifier, and never written onto the local config
//! entry**. Measurement said the stable identifier did not exist: a `.brxt`
//! install recorded no provenance whatsoever. `BrxtInstallModal.tsx` wrote
//! `{name, description, type, cmd, args, envs, env_keys, timeout}` into
//! `ExtensionConfig::Stdio` and `installBrxtBundle` returned only
//! `{ installDir }`, so the only join available was the accident that
//! `name_to_key` reduces the registry `id` (`cdwagent`) and the bundle
//! `manifest.name` (`CDWAgent`) to the same string. Rename the config entry and
//! the join misses — which removed **enforcement**, since Gates C, E, F1 and F2
//! all read that answer, not merely the badge.
//!
//! This module is the missing half: the install path records the registry id
//! (plus the download URL and the bundle's hash, which cost nothing to keep and
//! are the two facts an incident response would want) beside the config entry,
//! and [`classify_extension`](super::classify_extension) resolves through it.
//!
//! # Why this is not on `ExtensionConfig`
//!
//! `extension_manager.rs` already records the reason `Extension.tier` was kept
//! off that struct: `ExtensionConfig` round-trips through user-writable
//! `config.yaml`, so anything on it is agent-editable. That is the exact hole
//! DR-23 exists to close, so provenance lives in its own file.
//!
//! # Why this file needs no gated writer — for the TIER
//!
//! Because the resolver **unions** rather than replaces. `classify_extension`
//! returns Private when *either* the config name or the recorded registry id is
//! in the compiled marketplace snapshot, so a record can only ever RAISE a
//! tier. Forging one, corrupting the file, or deleting it outright cannot lower
//! the tier below what the name alone already said — which is precisely
//! DR-23's own argument that re-deriving *removes* the problem instead of
//! guarding it. Sessions have exactly one gated writer because a session's tier
//! is stored; an extension's is not, and this file stores identity, not tier.
//!
//! ⚠ **That argument is about the tier and does not extend to the AFFILIATION,
//! which Task 47 added to the same resolution.** Read this paragraph before
//! citing the one above as the reason a new consumer needs no writer gate.
//!
//! Union raises a tier because Private is the restrictive end of that lattice.
//! On the third axis the direction inverts: an
//! [`ExtensionAffiliation::Institutions`](super::affiliation::ExtensionAffiliation::Institutions)
//! set is an **allowlist**, so unioning two of them produces a *more* permissive
//! extension — reachable from more institutions' models without the
//! cross-affiliation warning DR-26 requires. An extra identity therefore raises
//! the tier and relaxes the affiliation in the same step.
//!
//! It is reachable the same way the tier's identities are: `config.yaml` is
//! agent-writable (DR-17 descoped the filesystem barrier), and an entry whose
//! `args` name another affiliated extension's recorded `install_dir` acquires
//! that extension's institutions. Where the name alone answers `{ucsf}`, the
//! unioned answer `{ucsf, stanford}` clears a Stanford-bound model's mismatch
//! silently — and DR-26 is explicit that an agent may never clear a mismatch
//! automatically.
//!
//! ⚠ **Latent, not live, and the distinction is the whole of the risk
//! assessment.** Every affiliated extension this build ships is `ucsf`, so every
//! union that can currently be formed is `{ucsf}` and no relaxation exists to
//! reach. It goes live the day a second institution enters `INSTITUTIONS` — i.e.
//! before Phase 6 is finished, not at some indefinite later date. The union is
//! what Task 47 specifies ("a base matching several institutions carries all of
//! them"), and *carrying* several institutions' data argues for the opposite
//! compatibility rule from *permitting* several institutions' models, so this
//! needs an explicit ruling rather than an implementer's guess. Recorded here
//! because whoever builds Tasks 48-51 will arrive at this header looking for the
//! reason forged records are harmless, and for the affiliation they are not.
//!
//! ⚠ **What a forged record CAN do is deny, and that is worth saying out loud.**
//! Raise-only means no disclosure, not no harm: a record naming a private
//! registry id and an `install_dir` shared by many configs would mark all of
//! them Private, and a public model would then be refused by every one. So the
//! directory match is deliberately narrow — whole-argument equality, and only
//! against a recorded value shaped like a path (`looks_like_a_path`), which is
//! what stops a record claiming `install_dir: "run"` from matching the `run` in every
//! `uv run --directory …` config the marketplace writes. Nothing here is a
//! privilege boundary; it is the difference between a wrong record costing one
//! extension and costing all of them.
//!
//! # Two implementations, one format
//!
//! The writer that matters today is TypeScript
//! (`ui/desktop/src/utils/extensionProvenance.ts`), because the registry id only
//! exists where the marketplace install happens. So [`PROVENANCE_FILE`], the
//! schema version, the field names and the [`name_to_key`] reduction all exist
//! twice, and each side unit-tests its own half against a hand-written fixture
//! rather than a shared one.
//!
//! ⚠ **Drift is silent and it is a DOWNGRADE**, which is the direction that
//! matters: a record the reader cannot find reads as "no provenance", and no
//! provenance returns a renamed entry to the config-name join. It does not throw
//! and it does not warn. The known divergence is deliberate and test-only — the
//! desktop hardcodes `~/.config/biorouter` while this side resolves through
//! [`Paths`], so the `BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT` seam moves one and not the other.
//! Anything else that diverges is a bug in whichever side moved.
//!
//! # What is stored
//!
//! `<config dir>/extension-provenance.json`, keyed by
//! [`name_to_key`](crate::config::extensions::name_to_key) of the config
//! entry's name — the same reduction the extension manager stores its map keys
//! under, so a lookup cannot miss on spelling:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "version": 1,
//!   "extensions": {
//!     "cdwagent": {
//!       "registry_id": "cdwagent",
//!       "source_url": "https://github.com/…/cdwagent.brxt",
//!       "bundle_sha256": "…",
//!       "recorded_at": "2026-08-03T19:00:00Z"
//!     }
//!   }
