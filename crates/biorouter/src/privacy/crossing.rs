//! The **first-crossing disclosure**: the state
//! [`visibility::requires_first_crossing_approval`] always needed and never had.
//!
//! A private-capability caller writing into a public conversation is permitted
//! (R4 — a private session may spawn and drive public children, and a rule that
//! lets you spawn one but never prompt it grants nothing). The prompt text is
//! still private-origin content arriving at a public model, so the **first**
//! such write from a given caller into a given target shows the user the exact
//! payload and waits for an answer.
//!
//! ⚠ **This module exists because retiring the lineage clause made the
//! disclosure load-bearing.** While WRITE was `VIS ∧ L ∈ {self, child}`, the
//! public targets a private caller could reach were the ones it had itself
//! spawned, so the crossing was one the caller had already arranged. It can now
//! write into any public conversation on the machine — a chat the user opened,
//! is reading, and never connected to this agent. The predicate had been sitting
//! unwired with an "OPERATOR DECISION OUTSTANDING" note against it; widening the
//! target set is what decided it.
//!
//! # Why the ledger is here and not in the permission store
//!
//! The approval card carries a `prompt`, and both the desktop and the CLI
//! deliberately suppress "Always Allow" whenever one is present
//! (`ToolCallConfirmation.tsx`, `session/mod.rs`'s `prompt_tool_confirmation`).
//! So the permission store can never learn this grant, and "first" has to be
//! remembered somewhere else. It is remembered per **(caller, target) pair**,
//! exactly as the predicate's own doc specifies.
//!
//! # Two properties that are easy to get backwards
//!
//! * **The crossing is recorded when the write LANDS, never when it is asked
//!   about.** [`needs_disclosure`] is a question; [`record`] is the answer's
//!   consequence. A refusal — the user denying the card, or the tier gate
//!   refusing underneath it — records nothing, so the next attempt asks again.
//!   Recording at the question would let one denied call buy silence for the
//!   next one.
//! * **It is process-local and deliberately not persisted.** The disclosure is
//!   about a running agent surprising a watching user, so "again after a
//!   restart" is the safe direction; a durable grant would silently outlive the
//!   session that earned it.
