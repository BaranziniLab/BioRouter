//! PAR-05b — `BIOROUTER_TOOL_MAX_CONCURRENT=1` still fully serializes a batch.
//!
//! This is the documented rollback lever for the whole §6.2 parallel-dispatch
//! change: if parallel tool execution ever misbehaves in the field, setting the
//! variable to 1 must restore strictly one-tool-at-a-time behaviour without a
//! rebuild. A lever nobody tests is a lever that does not work, so this gate
//! drives the real dispatch path with it set and asserts NO two tools overlap.
//!
//! Its own test binary for two reasons: the variable is process-global, and the
//! semaphore behind it is a `LazyLock` built on FIRST acquisition — so the value
//! has to be in the environment before any tool in the process dispatches. That
//! is a real operational constraint, not just a test artifact: setting the
//! variable on a *running* daemon has no effect, it must be set at start-up.
