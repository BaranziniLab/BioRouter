//! PAR-05a — the 8-permit dispatch semaphore actually bounds a wide batch.
//!
//! `tool_dispatch_limits` caps concurrent tool futures at
//! `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_TOOLS` (8). The unit tests cover the permit
//! arithmetic; this one measures the cap on the REAL dispatch path, because the
//! permit is acquired inside the tool future (`agent.rs`) and a refactor that
//! moved or dropped that acquisition would leave the unit tests green.
//!
//! Each of 12 tools marks itself live, samples how many tools are live at that
//! moment, then clears its mark. The peak sample is the observed concurrency.
//! Every tool samples into its OWN file, so the per-path write locks never
//! serialize the probes and confound the measurement.
//!
//! Its own test binary: it asserts against the compiled default, so it must not
//! share a process with the `BIOROUTER_TOOL_MAX_CONCURRENT` override test.
