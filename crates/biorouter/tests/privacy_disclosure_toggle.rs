//! Task 30A (issue #56, DR-17 requirement 3): the disclosure is independent of
//! the master toggle.
//!
//! ⚠ **Why this is an integration binary and not `--lib`.** The master switch is
//! a PROCESS-GLOBAL atomic and `cargo test` runs a crate's unit tests in
//! parallel threads of ONE process, so a unit test that moved it would be read
//! by the ~60 privacy tests beside it — which would fail spuriously or, worse,
//! pass while asserting nothing. `crates/biorouter/tests/privacy_toggle.rs`
//! documents the same hazard and takes the same way out. Each `tests/*.rs` file
//! is its own process, so this file's writes reach nothing but this file.
//!
//! ⚠ **This is the one part of the feature that must work with the toggle OFF.**
//! DR-15 turns off gates, the ratchet and refusals; it does not turn off the
//! truth. With enforcement off the exposure is *larger*, so wiring the
//! disclosure behind `privacy_tiers_enabled()` — the natural mistake, because
//! every other privacy surface reads it — would silence it in exactly the
//! configuration where the risk is highest.
