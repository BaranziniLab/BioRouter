//! PAR-06 — `BIOROUTER_TOOL_RESPONSE_STREAMING=0` restores pre-§6.2c ordering.
//!
//! §6.2c moved tool-response emission into the execution loop, so the live
//! transcript surfaces each result in COMPLETION order. The kill switch is the
//! documented rollback: with it off, every response is yielded from the
//! post-batch loop in REQUEST order again.
//!
//! `streaming_tool_response_ordering.rs` gates the switch's ON behaviour (fast
//! result streams before its slow sibling). This gate is the mirror image, and
//! together they prove the flag actually selects between two behaviours rather
//! than being dead config.
//!
//! Either way the PERSISTED order must stay REQUEST order — that invariant is
//! not the flag's to change, so it is asserted here too.
//!
//! Its own test binary: the variable is process-global and read per dispatch, so
//! a sibling test in the same process would race it.
