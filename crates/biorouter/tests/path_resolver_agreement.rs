//! `biorouter-mcp` cannot depend on `biorouter` (circular), so it carries its own
//! copy of the config-dir resolver. This test — in the one crate that can see
//! both — pins the two together.
//!
//! It exists because three hand-rolled `choose_app_strategy(...)` calls in
//! `biorouter-mcp` silently ignored `BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT`, so an isolated run
//! (a test drive, a worktree, a per-app jail) wrote its drafted apps into, and
//! read knowledge bases out of, the user's **global** store. If someone adds a
//! fourth hand-rolled resolver, this fails.
//!
//! ⚠ There is a THIRD resolver, in a language this test cannot reach:
//! `ui/desktop/src/utils/biorouterPaths.ts`, the Electron main process's one
//! derivation (#146). It matters for the same reason as the others and more so,
//! because it WRITES — the `.brxt` handlers create, extract into and
//! *recursively delete* the extensions directory — so a disagreement there is a
//! sandbox escape rather than a stale read. Its own suite,
//! `ui/desktop/src/utils/extensionUpdater.test.ts`, pins the same rules from
//! the other side, including the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and Windows layouts this
//! file's `Paths::config_dir()` calls resolve through `etcetera`. The two
//! change together or not at all.

/// | `"   "`    | **`   /config`**        | platform dir         |

/// `Paths::get_dir` uses `if let Ok(test_root) = env::var(…)`, and `env::var`
/// returns `Ok("")` for a variable that is exported but empty — so the daemon
/// resolves a **cwd-relative** `./config`.
///
/// **The decision: blank means unset.** Not taste — a relative config dir has
/// no cross-process meaning at all. The daemon, the CLI and the desktop main
/// process each have their own working directory, so `./config` names a
/// different tree in each of them; mirroring the literal reading elsewhere
/// cannot restore agreement, it only spreads the damage (in the desktop's case,
/// onto a handler that recursively deletes). Every other resolver on both sides
/// of the boundary already reads a blank value as absent: `resolve_config_dir`
/// tests `!root.trim().is_empty()`, `routes::shell::home_dir` applies the same
/// rule to `HOME` (`.filter(|p| !p.as_os_str().is_empty())`), and `main.ts`'s
/// `expandBiorouterPath` has always had an `if (!pathRoot)` that an empty
/// string falls through. `ui/desktop/src/utils/biorouterPaths.ts` now states it
/// explicitly for the whole desktop main process, and its suite pins it.
///
/// ⚠ **The authoritative resolver is the one holdout, and this test does not
/// pretend otherwise.** The fix is one line in
/// `crates/biorouter/src/config/paths.rs` —
/// `std::env::var("BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT").ok().filter(|root| !root.trim().is_empty())`
/// — which this test is written to survive: once it lands the two resolvers
/// agree outright and the second assertion's escape hatch stops being used.
/// Until then a blank root is a broken sandbox, but a broken sandbox that
/// writes to a relative path is not the same failure as one that writes to the
/// user's real tree, and only the second is a sandbox *escape*.
