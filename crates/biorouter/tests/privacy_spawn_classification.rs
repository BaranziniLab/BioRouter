//! Issue #56, finding 11: **turning the master switch off must not mint rows
//! that turning it back on cannot correct.**
//!
//! DR-15's switch is allowed to suspend *enforcement*. It is not allowed to
//! corrupt *classification*, and the two are different things: the gates in
//! `apply_settings_overrides` are behind `privacy_tiers_enabled()`, so with the
//! switch off a Private-classified chat may be bound to and may run a public
//! provider — and its subagent's row, if it were stamped from the child's
//! capability alone, would be born permanently `public`. Permanently, because
//! re-enabling never revisits a row (AR-7). The documented opt-out would then be
//! a way to launder a private chat's lineage into public rows, which is a worse
//! outcome than the enforcement it was asked to suspend.
//!
//! ⚠ **Why this is its own integration binary and not a `--lib` test.**
//! `set_privacy_tiers_enabled` mutates a PROCESS-GLOBAL atomic and `cargo test`
//! runs a crate's unit tests in parallel threads of one process, so flipping it
//! from a lib test would make `crates/biorouter/src/**`'s privacy tests read
//! `false` while asserting — spuriously failing, or worse, passing while
//! asserting nothing. Each `tests/*.rs` file is its own process. This is the
//! same reasoning, and the same guard shape, as `privacy_toggle.rs`.
//!
//! ⚠ **Why it is not a row in `privacy_toggle.rs`'s matrix.** That matrix asserts
//! what each gate does in each column. This is the opposite kind of claim — an
//! INVARIANT that must hold identically in both columns, like its row 17 (the
//! copy path) — and its subject is a SEQUENCE (classify while on → spawn while
//! off → re-enable → read the row) rather than a single call in each column.
//!
//! The ungated half of the same fix — that a child is never born below its
//! parent, with the toggle untouched — is asserted beside the code, in
//! `subagent_tool.rs`'s
//! `a_child_is_never_born_below_the_classification_of_its_parent`.
