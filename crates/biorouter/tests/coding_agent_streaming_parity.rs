//! **The parity gate.** A coding-agent turn must reach the transcript in the
//! same shape an API-provider turn does, because that shape is the entire
//! contract the GUI renders from.
//!
//! The GUI has no provider-specific branch for tool cards:
//! `ToolCallWithResponse` pairs a `ToolRequest` with the `ToolResponse` carrying
//! the same id, reads the name out of the request, colours the card from
//! `isError` on the result, and expands the arguments and the output. So "the
//! same thing the user sees" means, precisely: the same sequence of message
//! shapes, with the same pairing, the same names, and the same success/failure
//! signal.
//!
//! ⚠ **The comparison is only worth anything if one side is real.** An earlier
//! version of this file built BOTH sides by hand — the mirrored side by calling
//! `mirror::request_message` directly — so the two agreed by construction and
//! the test could not fail for any bug in the decoders or the providers. It has
//! been rewritten to drive **recorded vendor frames** through the real
//! `ClaudeCodeProvider::stream`, via a fake `claude` that replays a fixture, and
//! to compare the result against a hand-written API-provider turn. The
//! hand-written side is the specification; the recorded side is the thing under
//! test.
