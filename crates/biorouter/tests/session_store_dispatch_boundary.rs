//! The session database, reached from inside `execute_code` — the door the
//! inspector chain never sees (issue #56).
//!
//! `SessionStoreInspector` is a [`ToolInspector`]: it runs in the agent loop,
//! over the tool requests a model returned, before the agent dispatches them.
//! The tool calls a script makes from inside `execute_code` do not go through
//! that loop at all — the JS host hands them straight to
//! `ExtensionManager::dispatch_tool_call` — so nothing inspected them, and the
//! module's compensation was a scan of the *script text* for a literal store
//! path. One line walks past it:
//!
//! ```js
//! const p = root + "/data/sessions/" + ["sessions", "db"].join(".");
//! shell({ command: "cat " + p });
//! ```
//!
//! There is no store path anywhere in that source. The same evasion is what made
//! `global_memory`'s boundary refusals necessary, and this module's header
//! declared the gap openly rather than closing it.
//!
//! Every test below is written in a shape the script scan cannot see, so what
//! they pin is the **boundary**, not the scan. The store here is a planted file
//! under a temp root (`BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT`), never the developer's own, and the
//! control at the bottom reads a decoy beside it successfully — which is what
//! makes "the marker did not come back" evidence of a refusal rather than of a
//! harness that cannot read files at all.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p biorouter --test session_store_dispatch_boundary`.
