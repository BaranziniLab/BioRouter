//! PAR-04 — cancelling a turn in the MIDDLE of a parallel tool batch.
//!
//! The batch execution loop breaks out of `select_all` the moment the cancel
//! token trips (`agent.rs`, the `is_token_cancelled` check inside the result
//! loop), abandoning any tool that has not yet returned. The post-batch loop
//! then still persists a `tool_use` + response pair for EVERY request in the
//! batch, including the abandoned ones — whose response slot is the empty
//! placeholder `Message` allocated up front.
//!
//! That is the half-persist hazard this gate pins. The invariant is not "every
//! tool finishes" (cancelling is allowed to abandon work); it is that whatever
//! is written to the session must stay REPLAYABLE:
//!
//!   * no `tool_use` may be persisted without a matching `tool_result`, because
//!     a provider replaying the session rejects an unmatched block outright;
//!   * no tool may be recorded twice;
//!   * the turn must actually end rather than hanging on the abandoned tool.
//!
//! A separate binary from the other batch gates because it drives its own
//! cancellation token and timing.
