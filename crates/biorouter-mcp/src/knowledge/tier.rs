//! The knowledge-base privacy tier (issue #56, design §9.3 B4).
//!
//! A knowledge base takes the tier of the most sensitive session that has
//! ingested into it. This module owns the store, the monotone raise and the
//! refusal; Task 10B calls `raise` from the four choke points and Task 10C
//! calls [`assert_reachable`] from the same four.
//!
//! A `bool` rather than an enum because `biorouter-mcp` cannot depend on
//! `biorouter`, where `ProviderTier` lives — see the task's decision (1).
//! `caller_is_private == true` is exactly `floor(Private) == Private`.
//!
//! ## Locking
//!
//! Every mutator here is `_unlocked` and takes NO lock. The knowledge root has
//! exactly one lock, `KnowledgeService::lock_root`, and both it and
//! `FileLockGuard` are private to the `service` module — a free function cannot
//! reach them, and `create_base`/`import_brkb`/`delete_base` are already inside
//! it when they call these. A second `FileLockGuard::acquire` in the same
//! process blocks forever (it opens a fresh fd and `flock`s exclusively).
//! Callers OUTSIDE the service use `KnowledgeService::raise_tier` /
//! `forget_tier`, which take the lock and delegate here. This is the tree's own
//! `_unlocked` convention — twenty helpers in `service.rs` already follow it.
//!
//! ## Known residuals
//!
//! ⚠ An earlier version of this block said `lock_root()` was in-process, that
//! two Biorouter processes could therefore lose a raise, and that closing it
//! "needs an OS advisory lock the tree does not have anywhere". All three are
//! false: `FileLockGuard::acquire` calls `file.lock_exclusive()` through
//! `fs2::FileExt` (`service.rs`), which IS flock/`LockFileEx` — cross-process,
//! and the same mechanism the paragraph above correctly relies on when it
//! explains why a second acquire in one process blocks. It is corrected rather
//! than deleted because inviting someone to "fix" a race the tree already closes
//! is worse than saying nothing, and because it obscured the two that are real:
//!
//! 1. **Readers take no lock, by design.** `is_private` and `has_entry_unlocked`
//!    never `flock`; they rely on the store being replaced only by `rename`, so
//!    a read sees the old file or the new one and never a torn one. What that
//!    does not give is freshness: a permit decided microseconds before a raise
//!    lands is still acted on. That is check-then-use, it is the same window
//!    Task 10A's own coverage note records for `primary_kb_for_context`, and
//!    closing it would mean holding the root lock across every knowledge read.
//! 2. **The lock is advisory and file-scoped.** Anything that edits `.kb-tiers`
//!    without going through `KnowledgeService` — a text editor, another tool —
//!    bypasses it entirely. The task accepts that: the file is machine-local and
//!    user-writable, and the threat model is "a public model reads private
//!    notes", not "a local attacker with a shell".
