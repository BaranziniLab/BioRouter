//! The master privacy-tier switch (issue #56, R7 / DR-15) — the STORAGE only.
//!
//! ⚠ **Why this lives in `biorouter-mcp` and not in `biorouter`.** `biorouter`
//! depends on `biorouter-mcp` and **not** the reverse (`crates/biorouter/Cargo.toml`),
//! and several enforcement points are inside this crate: the knowledge-base read
//! barrier (`knowledge::tier::assert_reachable`), the classification ratchet
//! (`knowledge::tier::raise_unlocked`), the forced export location
//! (`knowledge::server::KnowledgeServer::kb_export`) and the Agent Drafter
//! catalog (`agent_drafter::catalog`). A `privacy_tiers_enabled()` defined in
//! `crates/biorouter/src/privacy/mod.rs` would be *unreachable* from every one
//! of them, so the honest outcomes would be either "those are not opt-outable" —
//! which contradicts DR-15 in the operator's own words — or a second hand-rolled
//! flag, which Task 30's Step 5 exists to forbid.
//!
//! So the atomic lives below both crates and there is still exactly one of it:
//! `crates/biorouter/src/privacy/mod.rs` **re-exports** the predicate rather
//! than wrapping it, so the token at every call site is identical in both crates
//! and the audit is one pattern, not two. This is the same shape the plan
//! already uses for `private_roots`.
//!
//! This module knows nothing about configuration. Loading the value is
//! `biorouter::privacy::load_privacy_tiers_from_config`, which reads
//! `privacy-tiers.json` — the record `biorouter::privacy::master_switch` owns,
//! beside `config.yaml` in this install's configuration directory.
//!
//! ⚠ **Not `config.yaml`, and not the environment** (issue #56, DR-22). The
//! value used to be a `config.yaml` key, `BIOROUTER_PRIVACY_TIERS`. That key is
//! now *retired*: read once at migration, removed, and ignored for ever after.
//! The agent holds `developer__shell`, so a value it could reach by writing a
//! file or exporting a variable would be a control the agent switches off and
//! waits one restart for — see `master_switch` for what the move does and does
//! not buy, and `load_privacy_tiers_from_config` for why the read never goes
//! through `Config::get_param`, whose middle branch resolves an environment
//! variable.
