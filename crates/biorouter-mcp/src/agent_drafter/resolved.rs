//! The *resolved* manifest view — what `read_app` shows the model.
//!
//! A serialized manifest is a **diff against defaults**: every optional block
//! carries `skip_serializing_if`, so an explicitly-chosen default disappears on
//! save. `theme.pack = "biorouter"` is `ThemeConfig::is_default()`, so it is
//! omitted; an empty `surface` is omitted; unset capabilities are omitted. That
//! is correct for the file on disk (a v1 manifest re-serializes byte-identically)
//! and *wrong* for a reader, which sees **absence** where the truth is
//! **default** — and which is never shown the shape of the fields it must fill in.
//!
//! Two real failures came out of that ambiguity:
//!
//!   * a reviewer read an omitted `theme` block as "no pack was set" and filed a
//!     bug against an app that had correctly set the default pack;
//!   * the authoring model, having no skeleton to edit, round-tripped whole
//!     manifests by guessing field shapes from serde errors — six rejected
//!     mutations per app.
//!
//! [`resolved_view`] emits a canonical, fully-populated, editable skeleton:
//! every optional block present, the theme pack resolved through
//! [`ThemeConfig::resolved_pack`], and a `_server_managed` list naming the keys
//! the caller must not invent. `read_app(view: "raw")` still returns the
//! on-disk bytes for anything that needs fidelity.
