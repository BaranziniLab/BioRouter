//! What this Biorouter install actually has.
//!
//! Agent Drafter's 12 tools were all create/configure/build/launch/read — **none
//! of them could ask what exists**. The authoring instructions nonetheless told
//! the model to give the app "the extensions/skills/knowledge it needs", and
//! `AgentConfig` had no field in which to say *"this app wants a ClinVar KB and
//! there isn't one"*. So the only way for the model to express the need was to
//! invent an id.
//!
//! It did, at scale. Across the 100-app test drive: 13 invented knowledge-base
//! ids, 7 nonexistent skill lists, and — memorably — the literal string `br.kb`,
//! which is the *client API namespace*, not an identifier. The runtime then made
//! it worse: the server armed the `skills` extension whenever the skill list was
//! non-empty (real or not) and wrote a system prompt commanding the model to use
//! skills that could not load, so turn 1 failed by construction.
//!
//! The model's error was epistemic — it could not see its environment — so no
//! amount of prompt text could fix it. This module is the missing eye. It backs:
//!
//!   * the `list_platform_catalog` tool (discovery),
//!   * write-boundary rejection in `create_app`/`configure_app` (an unknown id
//!     cannot be saved),
//!   * the `requires` manifest block (a typed slot for an unmet need), and
//!   * the runtime capability report (what was requested vs what is real).
