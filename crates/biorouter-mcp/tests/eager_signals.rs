//! Declaring a signal IS subscribing to it.
//!
//! This is the fix for the single worst result in the 100-app test drive:
//! app→agent signals round-tripped **1 time in 12**. The cause was an
//! unwinnable ordering race, not model sloppiness:
//!
//!   1. the bridge's subscription set started **empty** on every connection;
//!   2. the only way to fill it was the agent voluntarily calling `ui_subscribe`;
//!   3. `validate_signal` failed closed on an unsubscribed name; and
//!   4. the server turned that failure into a warning and **dropped the payload**.
//!
//! But the user's first click necessarily happens *before* the agent's first tool
//! call. The gesture that mattered most was always validated against an empty set.
//! No prompt can win a race that is decided before any prompt is evaluated — one
//! probe called `ui_subscribe` five times in a row trying.
//!
//! These tests assert the contract now holds with **zero tool calls**.
