//! #64, end-to-end: delete a session working directory out from under the
//! `text_editor` tool and observe what the tool actually does.
//!
//! The unit tests added with the fix drive the private `resolve_path_jailed`
//! helper. This drives the **public tool an agent actually calls**, through the
//! same entry point the MCP dispatch uses, against a real filesystem — so it
//! pins the behaviour a user would see rather than the behaviour of an internal
//! helper. The two things it has to show are the two things #64 weighed against
//! each other:
//!
//! 1. the process survives (the old `expect("should have a current working
//!    dir")` took it down), and
//! 2. the jail is **not** re-rooted onto the process cwd — a file that was
//!    refused while the session directory existed is still refused after it
//!    disappears, and is still not written.
//!
//! Point 2 is the one that matters: "don't panic" must not be paid for with a
//! wider security boundary.
//!
//! This test owns the process cwd and `BIOROUTER_WORKING_DIR`, so it is a single
//! sequential test in its own integration binary rather than several parallel
//! ones.
