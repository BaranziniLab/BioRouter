//! DR-15 / AR-7 for the KB-to-KB merge: with the master privacy toggle OFF,
//! the merge's classification fold does not ratchet — and its **dry run** says
//! so rather than promising a raise that will not happen.
//!
//! ⚠ **Why this is an integration binary and not a `#[cfg(test)] mod` beside
//! the merge.** The toggle is a PROCESS-GLOBAL atomic and `cargo test` runs a
//! crate's unit tests in parallel threads of one process, so an OFF window
//! written next to the code would disable the barrier under the ~250 knowledge
//! unit tests that neither take the guard nor can be made to. Same reason
//! `privacy_toggle_export.rs` and `privacy_toggle_kb_listing.rs` are their own
//! binaries; each `tests/*.rs` file is its own process, so nothing outside this
//! file observes its writes.
//!
//! ⚠ **What it would catch.** The projection in
//! `KnowledgeService::projected_classification` re-derives the ratchet's
//! arithmetic rather than performing it — that is the one duplication in the
//! feature, and it is bounded by reading the toggle through
//! `tier::ratchets_are_live`, the same spelling both ratchets read. If a future
//! edit gives the preview a read of its own, this file is where the two come
//! apart: with the feature off, the preview would announce `private` and the
//! merge would leave the base public.
