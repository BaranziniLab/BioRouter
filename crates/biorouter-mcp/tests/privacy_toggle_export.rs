//! Task 30, matrix row 15 (`archive`): the forced export location follows the
//! master privacy toggle (issue #56, DR-15).
//!
//! ⚠ **Why this is an integration binary and not a `#[cfg(test)] mod` beside
//! `kb_export`.** The toggle is a PROCESS-GLOBAL atomic and `cargo test` runs a
//! crate's unit tests in parallel threads of one process. Written next to the
//! code it exercises, this test's OFF window disabled the barrier under
//! `no_tool_that_names_a_base_reaches_a_private_one_under_a_public_model` and
//! `an_imported_base_takes_the_importing_sessions_tier_or_the_archives_floor`,
//! which do not take the guard and cannot be made to — there are ~250 of them.
//! Measured, not predicted: both failed on the first run. Each `tests/*.rs` file
//! is its own process, so nothing outside this file can observe its writes.
//!
//! ⚠ **Why the fixture is rebuilt rather than reused.** `KnowledgeServer`'s
//! fields are private and `server_with_root` is a `#[cfg(test)]` helper of the
//! module, so an integration test cannot root a server at a temp directory
//! directly. It goes through `KnowledgeServer::new()`, which resolves its root
//! from `BIOROUTER_PATH_ROOT` — the same resolution the shipped daemon uses.
