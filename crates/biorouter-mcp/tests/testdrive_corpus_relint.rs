//! Re-lint the real apps the 100-app test drive produced.
//!
//! This is the regression corpus. Every app under
//! `.br-testdrive/runtime/config/biorouter/agent_drafter/` was authored by Agent
//! Drafter during the audit, and every one of them shipped with at least one of
//! the defects this campaign fixes. The audit's verdict was 0/18 full functional
//! passes.
//!
//! The point of this test is not to make those apps pass — they were authored
//! against the broken platform and would need re-authoring. The point is to prove
//! the fixed platform **now sees** what it was blind to: that the checks which
//! would have caught these apps at build time actually fire on the real artifacts,
//! not just on hand-written fixtures.
//!
//! Skips cleanly when the corpus is absent (it is git-ignored runtime state), so
//! this is a no-op on a fresh clone and on CI.
