//! #68, the third route to the same widening: keep the *path* of the session
//! working directory alive but change what it points at.
//!
//! The jail refuses to move to another directory when its base disappears —
//! but it only ever asked "does this path name a directory?" and then
//! canonicalized it. `Path::is_dir` follows symlinks, so deleting
//! `/parent/session` and dropping a symlink to `/parent` in its place answers
//! yes, canonicalization then resolves the base to `/parent`, and every sibling
//! the jail refused a moment earlier is suddenly inside it. Nothing about the
//! base the caller sanctioned changed textually; the directory it denotes did.
//!
//! Driven through the public `text_editor` tool with a real symlink swap, so it
//! pins what a user would see rather than an internal helper's return value.
//! Owns the process environment, so it is a single test in its own integration
//! binary.
