//! An id that does not exist cannot be saved.
//!
//! This is the regression corpus for the 100-app test drive's worst
//! configuration failures. Across 18 authored apps, Agent Drafter configured 13
//! knowledge-base ids and 7 skill lists that did not exist on the machine it was
//! running on — including the literal string `br.kb`, which is the client API
//! namespace, not an identifier. Every one of those apps then failed its first
//! turn, because the server armed the tools anyway.
//!
//! These tests take the *actual ids from the test drive* and assert each is now
//! rejected at the write boundary, with an error that names what is really
//! installed.
