//! DR-15 over the **one** predicate every knowledge-base listing now asks
//! (issue #56; audit finding 17).
//!
//! # What this pins, and why one test covers three surfaces
//!
//! Before finding 17 there were three spellings of "may this caller see this
//! base?" — `KnowledgeServer`'s five listings, `resolve_target_kb`'s
//! conversation-ingest candidate list in `biorouter`, and `Catalog::discover`'s
//! app catalogue here — and they disagreed about *which axes* and *whether the
//! master toggle applied*. `resolve_target_kb` did not read the toggle at all,
//! so with privacy tiers switched OFF it went on withholding the names of bases
//! the very next call would hand over in full. That is DR-15's promise
//! ("nothing will be impacted") broken in the direction nobody looks.
//!
//! All three now delegate to [`KbCaller::can_reach`], which is
//! `tier::assert_reachable` negated — so the toggle is read once, at the choke
//! point, for the "omit" decision and the "refuse" decision together. Asserting
//! the toggle at that predicate is therefore the assertion for every listing
//! that asks it; a surface that stopped asking it would be caught by the
//! source-text guards beside each one (`caller.rs`, `server.rs`).
//!
//! # Why this is an integration binary
//!
//! Verbatim the reason `privacy_toggle_export.rs` records: the toggle is a
//! PROCESS-GLOBAL atomic and `cargo test` runs a crate's unit tests in parallel
//! threads of ONE process. An OFF window opened inside `--lib` disables the
//! barrier under the ~250 knowledge tests that neither take a guard nor can be
//! made to. Each `tests/*.rs` file is its own process, so nothing outside this
//! file can observe its writes.
