//! BR-71 CLI parity gate (operator requirement, 2026-07-30).
//!
//! One row per workspace capability, mapping it to the CLI that delivers it.
//! Three properties are enforced, and the FIRST is a compile error rather than a
//! test failure:
//!
//! 1. `cli_counterpart` and `surface` are exhaustive `match`es with **no
//!    wildcard arm**. A new `WorkspaceCapability` variant that nobody gave a CLI
//!    row is `error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns` — the build fails.
//! 2. The tool-backed rows equal `WorkspaceClient::get_tools()` exactly, and the
//!    route-backed rows equal the `workspace`-tagged OpenAPI operations exactly.
//!    So a capability added to a *surface* without a variant here is a red test.
//! 3. Every row resolves against the real clap tree.
//!
//! Together: a capability cannot enter the daemon or the GUI without either a
//! working CLI counterpart or a written, bounded, operator-visible exception.
//!
//! ⚠ `ALL_CAPABILITIES` is hand-listed (counting enum variants needs a derive
//! this crate does not carry). It cannot go stale *usefully*: a variant added to
//! the enum but omitted here describes a surface entry that property 2 then
//! reports as unclaimed. A variant omitted here that describes NOTHING is
//! already dead code.
//!
//! # What this gate cannot see
//!
//! Measured against the tree on 2026-07-31, not recalled. The task that created
//! this file required each of these to be *stated* the moment it became true
//! rather than discovered by whoever trusts the gate later, so they live here —
//! next to the mechanism — and not only in a PR comment.
//!
//! ## 1. The `GET /ui/workspace` frame vocabulary — and the one frame that has
//! now outgrown the argument for tolerating it
//!
//! utoipa does not describe WebSocket upgrades, so no frame reaches
//! `openapi.json` and check B cannot see one. The task accepted that on a
//! specific argument: every frame is the GUI *rendering* of a `workspace_*`
//! tool the table already covers. Traced against the real emitters, five of the
//! six frame kinds the daemon sends today do hold that shape:
//!
//! | frame | emitted by | covered by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `open_tab`, `open_window` | `workspace_extension::place_in_gui`, `subagent_tool` | `C::Open`, `C::Spawn` |
//! | `close_tab` | `workspace_extension::handle_close` | `C::Close` |
//! | `notify` | `workspace_extension::notify_target`, called from send-prompt/steer, set-tools, close, and the focus-etiquette downgrade of an open frame | `C::SendPrompt`, `C::SetTools`, `C::Close`, `C::Open` |
//! | `annotate_tab` | `subagent_tool` | `C::Spawn` |
//!
//! The sixth does **not**. `resolve_confirmation`
//! (`biorouter-server/src/routes/action_required.rs`) is pushed by
//! `POST /action-required/tool-confirmation` and stands behind no `workspace_*`
//! tool at all. The task said that if such a frame ever appeared, this gate
//! could not see it and the fact had to be reported rather than allowed to
//! pass quietly. It has appeared; this is that report.
//!
//! It is **not** a parity violation, for a reason worth writing down rather
//! than assuming. The capability underneath the frame is "answer a
//! tool-permission ask", and the CLI has had it since long before BR-71:
//! `biorouter-cli/src/session/mod.rs` prompts the user and calls
//! `Agent::handle_confirmation` directly. The frame itself is not a capability
//! but the *dismissal of a duplicate card on a second rendering surface*, and
//! that second surface is manufactured by `session_events::publish` in
//! `agents/tool_execution.rs` — an ephemeral bus the GUI observes. A terminal
//! prompt is local and blocking, so there is no second card for any CLI
//! counterpart to dismiss.
//!
//! It is deliberately given **no row**, and both halves of that are choices:
//! `tag = "workspace"` would mislabel the universal confirmation endpoint that
//! every session already uses as workspace control, in a document we publish;
//! and the only row shape that fits a capability with no subcommand is a third
//! `Asymmetry`, which check D rejects. Raising that cap to make an exception
//! fit is precisely the gate-weakening this file exists to prevent.
//!
//! **The residual risk, stated plainly:** a future frame that *carries* a
//! capability instead of rendering one would ship GUI-only with this gate
//! green. Closing that needs the frame vocabulary to be enumerable from code —
//! a shared `const` the emitters spell from, not a grep over `json!` literals.
//! (A source scanner is the obvious cheap fix and is a trap: `open_tab` writes
//! `"type"` and `"cmd"` on one line while `resolve_confirmation` splits them
//! across two, so the one-line regex anyone would reach for first misses the
//! exact frame that motivated the work.)
//!
//! ## 2. The renderer's hand-rolled daemon calls
//!
//! Gating the daemon's surface gates the GUI's *because* the renderer can only
//! reach what `ui/desktop/openapi.json` describes — every workspace call site
//! goes through the generated `ui/desktop/src/api/`. The task measured the
//! exceptions at `aad74e79`: two `getApiUrl` consumers, neither
//! workspace-related, and it instructed that a third on a workspace route
//! weakens the argument and must be said out loud.
//!
//! There is now a third, and it *is* on a workspace route:
//! `ui/desktop/src/hooks/useWorkspaceChannel.ts` derives its socket URL from
//! `getApiUrl('/ui/workspace')`. So the measurement no longer holds as
//! written. The argument survives, narrowly: that call is the Task 23 WebSocket
//! this file already carves out in §1 above — a transport, reached the only way
//! a WebSocket can be reached when the generator cannot describe it — not a new
//! hand-rolled HTTP call against a capability route. What would genuinely break
//! the argument is a fourth consumer doing `fetch(getApiUrl('/some/workspace/
//! thing'))`, and that is the thing to re-measure when this is next touched.
//!
//! ## 3. The route half is honour-system
//!
//! Only the *enum* carries the compile-time property. Nothing forces someone
//! adding a workspace route to touch this file, so an untagged new route fails
//! nothing here — which is exactly how `resolve_confirmation`'s endpoint sits
//! outside the gate today. Check B is an equality between the table and the
//! **tagged** operations, so it catches a tag that is added or removed, never a
//! tag that was never applied.
//!
//! ## 4. Rows are coarser than the capabilities they certify
//!
//! Deliberate — the table is written "at the granularity a user cares about" —
//! but it means a capability can be partly GUI-only with the gate green.
//! `C::Close` certifies a tool with `tab`/`turn`/`agent` scopes against a
//! subcommand that implements `turn`; `C::ReadConversation` certifies four
//! views against a transcript exporter. And check C proves a subcommand
//! *exists*, never that it is equivalent: rows with `args: &[]` assert
//! existence alone. Task 38c's live step and Task 44's `session attach` run are
//! what cover behaviour.
