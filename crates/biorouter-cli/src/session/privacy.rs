//! Issue #56 Task 31 — the CLI's privacy surfaces (R10).
//!
//! Every repair affordance Phase 4 shipped before this is a GUI card, and the
//! CLI is not an optional surface: a user who never opens the desktop app must
//! still be able to see what tier a chat is on, understand why one refused to
//! start, and get out of it.
//!
//! Three things live here, and they are pure functions with the registry lookup
//! split off, so all of the wording is testable without a terminal:
//!
//! * [`tier_row`] — the `privacy` row of the session banner.
//! * [`terminal_refusal`] — the sentence a private chat gets when the provider
//!   resolved for it is public, whichever of the four precedence sources
//!   produced it, plus the repair.
//! * [`available_private_models`] — what the repair offers, read from the real
//!   provider registry so a fourth private provider appears with no edit here.
//!
//! ⚠ **The list is sorted, and the sort is load-bearing.** `providers()`
//! iterates a `HashMap`, so its order differs between runs; a refusal that named
//! whichever private model came out first would print a different "exact re-run
//! command" every time, which is worse than printing none.

/// indistinguishable from one made by a public-tier caller — which is why
/// `session send/watch/attach` were refused for a private chat even when the
/// terminal was configured for an institutional model. A capability is not
/// something a surface has by being a surface; it is a fact about the model
/// bound to it, and until something resolved that fact there was nothing for a
/// gate to compare.
///
/// ⚠ **The DECLARED tier, not an instance's.** `declared_provider_tier` reads
/// the registry, because building an instance would need the provider's
/// credentials just to answer a routing question, and because the daemon
/// resolves the same name through the same function on its side — two different
/// resolutions of one name is how the client and the daemon come to disagree
/// about what a request is allowed to do. The residual is inherited and
/// permissive in the same direction the rest of the feature already accepts (an
/// `ollama` re-pointed off the machine by `OLLAMA_HOST` declares Private and
/// resolves Public), and it is not the authority: every gate downstream reads
